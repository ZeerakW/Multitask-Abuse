Would we accept this as falsification of the hypothesis on which the prediction was based? I suspect not, as we know that fossilisation (in the first instance) and the uncovering of said fossils (in the second) are contingent, not necessary, events.  By Popperian criteria, if we would not accept a nil result as falsification, we cannot trumpet a positive result as validation.

They have the right to free speech even free speech, I or anyone else diagrees with. This does not mean that I think that they do not have to take responsiblity for the speech. With freedom comes responsiblity. The law suit for pain and suffering, I think is just.  Oh so many law suits to plan. Because with freedom of religion and religious speech comes responsiblity. This case now sets Precedent, that if I find religious speech hurtfull, or the actions of religious groups trying to fight gay people, marriage, or gay rights, I could sue for pain and suffering.

The video reveals Dr. Tiller showcasing massive and graphic pictures of children with fetal abnormalities that he had aborted, so as to make the case for late-term abortions as necessary medical procedure. SFLA's Executive Director Kristan Hawkins, who videotaped the conference and interviewed Tiller clandestinely, commented on the gruesome pictures of aborted children Tiller showed, saying,  One had an extra arm: could not that child had survived and received corrective surgery?

4forums_336	fact-4forums-boot1	Well, the easy answer is that a lizard didn't evolve an avian lung. There is no known example of a lizard that has an avian lung. However, there is a variety of lung morphologies found in reptiles, including simple sacs in some lizards to the partitioned chambers with intricate support structures in organisms such as monitor lizards and crocodilians. And I am sure that peddler is aware that the crocodilians are the closest living relatives of birds, having arisen from an ancestral archosaur. The dinosaurs, through the ornithodirans, also arose from archosaurs. So the more advanced lung structure may have been ancestral since lizards arose from ancestral diapsids which also gave rise to the archosaurs.  So some birds have a system of (usually) 9 flexible air sacs that that act as bellows to move air through the lungs. Although the air sacs are not directly involved in respiration, they do have other functions, such as thermoregulation and weight reduction. Extensions of these air sacs have invaded the skeleton and form what are called pneumatic bones in birds.  However, there is considerable evidence that this condition occurred in organisms ancestral to birds first. Thus, in the maniraptoriformes it may have been useful in weight reduction in running predators and was retained in birds because the weight reduction was also useful for flight.  But some birds, current and fossil, do not have pneumatic bones. For example, Hesperonis lacked them for obvious reasons. But of course, Hesperonis lacked wings useful for flight.  Looks like peddler is just a parrot of what his controlers have told him to say. To bad he lacks the integrity to educate himself.

4forums_11082	fact-4forums-boot1	Radiocarbon is nevr used for 'millions of years'. It's used to measure human developments.  I suggest you read this.  Radiometric dating--the process of determining the age of rocks from the decay of their radioactive elements--has been in widespread use for over half a century. There are over forty such techniques, each using a different radioactive element or a different way of measuring them. It has become increasingly clear that these radiometric dating techniques agree with each other and as a whole, present a coherent picture in which the Earth was created a very long time ago. Further evidence comes from the complete agreement between radiometric dates and other dating methods such as counting tree rings or glacier ice core layers. Many Christians have been led to distrust radiometric dating and are completely unaware of the great number of laboratory measurements that have shown these methods to be consistent. Many are also unaware that Bible-believing Christians are among those actively involved in radiometric dating.  This paper describes in relatively simple terms how a number of the dating techniques work, how accurately the half-lives of the radioactive elements and the rock dates themselves are known, and how dates are checked with one another. In the process the paper refutes a number of misconceptions prevalent among Christians today. This paper is available on the web via the American Scientific Affiliation and related sites to promote greater understanding and wisdom on this issue, particularly within the Christian community.

Why is a single  perfect  mutation required as opposed to one of millions that take place in a population at every generation that may offer a slight reproductive advantage? As Gould often asked, do  historical patterns of development represent a set of mechanically limited and excellent, perhaps even optimal, designs,  or  do they represent just one possible solution among numerous entirely plausible alternatives of strikingly different form, each yielding a subsequent history of life entirely different from the outcome actually experienced on earth?  (Gould, Stephen Jay. 2002. The Structure of Evolutionary Theory. The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA. p. 1159) Thus, the likelihood of a mutation is not determined because subsequent evolution would have been impossible without it. The mutation preceded the path of evolution. There was no goal towards which evolution was aimed.  Ted Dace (not a scientist), Bertvan, and ww all seem to have evolutionary theory backasswards.

Malik Nadal Hasan  Â© 2009 WorldNetDaily  An Army soldier opened fire at Fort Hood in Texas, killing 11 soldiers and wounding 31, before he was killed by a local police officer.  The Army identified the suspected gunman as Maj. Malik Nadal Hasan. A local radio reporter said Hasan is a Muslim convert.  Retired Maj. Gen. Robert Scales told Fox News the massacre did not appear to be the act of a mentally ill or extremely stressed person.   This was a deliberate act of execution,  he said.  The shooter was immediately killed, according to Lt. Gen. Bob Cone, a base spokesman, and two additional suspects, also soldiers, have been apprehended.  One incident, at about 1:30 p.m. Central Time, took place at a medical processing center, a second took place at a theater on the base, Lt Col Nathan Banks at the Pentagon told the Associated Press.  The base, about 60 miles from Austin, and two area school districts are on lockdown.  Greg Schannep, an aide to U.S. Rep. John Carter, said he was on the Army post to attend a graduation service, the Austin American-Statesman newspaper reported. As he neared the entrance of a building where the service was being held, he said, a soldier with blood on his uniform ran past him and said a man was shooting.  Schannep told the paper the shootings appeared to have occurred in a complex near the theater where the service was scheduled.  CNN reported President Obama has been advised of the shooting. White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said the president is being kept updated. CNN said staffers have gathered in the situation room, possibly as a precautionary measure since details are still emerging.  The FBI reportedly was en route.  Sgt. Major Jamie Posten of the Fort Hood public affairs office said shooting took place  near the soldier readiness processing center, where soldiers cycle through as they prepare to deploy.   Posten said soldiers go to the center up to 60 days before deployment to begin the process of vaccinations and other preparation.   It's still developing. We're trying to figure out what took place on the ground,  he said.  Fort Hood, home to at least 4,929 active duty officers and 45,414 enlisted, is the largest U.S. military complex in the world.

4forums_7827	fact-4forums-boot1	I find the neo-marxist approach to political science interesting and useful. Largely because it accuratly describes and accounts for certain important underlying structures of our contemporary world. It is also flecxible enough to apply to more than just issues concerning economic classes.  I find marxist approach to economics interesting from a historic point of view, but not that useful. Basicly that is because many of the assumptions and predictions marxism made has since been falsefied and I have yet to see any rendition of the theories of old into anything useful.  I find Communism, as a state-less utopia based on solidarity and community, void of property ownership and class conflict a beutiful idea. But I don`t think it can be achieved through pursuing the socialistic state of pure governmental ownership of the means of production. In fact, I`m quite sceptic that it ever can be achieved (regardless of how you pursue it)  I find the stalinist and maoist attempts to interpret marxism and apply it to the real world one of the largest attrocities commited throughout modern history. Not only to the hundreds of thousands in the Gulabs and chinese prisons or the millions of victims of starvation or political violence, but also to all of those who actually believed in the proletarian revulotion and where sourly dissapointed when they found themselves slavering in the iron-mines i Kaukasus or working in the rice-fields with a gun-barrel as the only motivation for working harder.  I find Socialism, as a practice of democratic ownership of means of production and re-distribution of resources from the more productive or wealthy to the less productive and poor as a good tool to build a succesful society. But as with any tool, it shouldn`t be used in every situation, but only when and where appropriate. When using the tool of socialism, you are most often distorting the effects of the other tools of market forces. This needs to be considered as the market forces have one important attribute, efficiency.  There`s a summarise of my oppinions and reasons for having them. How do you feel about marxism, socialism and communism, and why?

On top of that, what we accomplish with our bigger brain is, as I've already demonstrated in other threads with reference to feral children, greatly dependent upon the accumulated wisdom imprinted upon the brain during infancy.

Even as adults, not everyone is equally quick-witted, not everyone has an equal facility for logical thought - and this has a lot to do with how their brain has been trained during its development.

And, even after its gone through the peer review process, it hasn't  proven  anything.  The conclusions are either supported by the evidence or they aren't.  Conclusions are drawn and explanations for phenomena are offered.  The explanations are accepted (for publication) if the peers (other scientists, sometimes competitors) are convinced that the explanations offered are valid.  There are plenty of papers about dinos>bird and fish>amphibians.  Well, there is now string theory, which has grown into M-theory, which may have a rational answer (at least a mathematical one). But calling it a theory is really a misnomer. It's more like a hypothetical model.  But, do you have a rational explanation for the Big Bang?  Or do you think that the Big Bang didn't happen?  Well, yeah, if science hasn't provided an explanation for a phenomenon, then all we can do is shrug and submit grant proposals.  Yes, of course the past can never be proven.  But there are indirect ways to determine what happened within a reasonable ball park.  We can assume that our solar system formed merely by matter coalescing by gravity and then behaving the way matter behaves when it's all clumped together by gravity. We can model it on a computer and if we get something that looks like our current solar system then we can say that the model is a good one and the chances that the solar system formed that way are increased. No, sorry, there is no proof, only explanations and models.  * - edit: you know, actually, evidence in the form of experimental results are reviewed, or at least the methods are reviewed, and then if the experiment isn't reproducible then the evidence becomes suspect, so in that light evidence is, sort of, reviewed.

Ayala FJ.  University of California, Irvine, USA.  It has been proposed that modern humans descended from a single woman, the  mitochondrial Eve  who lived in Africa 100,000 to 200,000 years ago. The human immune system DRB1 genes are extremely polymorphic, with gene lineages that coalesce into an ancestor who lived around 60 million years ago, a time before the divergence of the apes from the Old World monkeys. The theory of gene coalescence suggests that, throughout the last 60 million years, human ancestral populations had an effective size of 100,000 individuals or greater. Molecular evolution data favor the African origin of modern humans, but the weight of the evidence is against a population bottleneck before their emergence. The mitochondrial Eve hypothesis emanates from a confusion between gene genealogies and individual genealogies.

On the other hand consider that the driver killed the woman AND obviously damaged her fetus beyond recovery - WITHOUT the consent of the woman. In other words the death of the fetus was not by consent of the person who holds the right to decide but rather by the negligence or intent of the guilty party.  And yes prior to her death (assumming all other requirements were met) she could have AT HER CHOICE and UN-COERCED have chosen to abort the fetus without incurring a legal penalty. But that would of course be much different.

Where did you get the idea that a dog evolved to a human? It's exactly that kind of comment that makes people with a smattering of scientific education say 'go read a book on biology before you say that dogs evolved into humans'.  Humans did not evolve from dogs and ToE has never suggested that this is so. It's that kind of comment that makes me wonder how much you know about biology.

4forums_9856	fact-4forums-boot1	Fascinating - you blew right through your own usual misunderstandings of Darwinism and Darwinists and ended up with a sentence that is actually meaningful.  HGT (along with genetic drift) are important parts of modern evolutionary theory, but they do indeed have nothing to do with darwinian evolution sensu stricto, which does indeed insist on natural selection. This is why evolutionary biologists object to being called Darwinists in the sense that you and WW usually try to impose on us, and it is why we insist that there is more to evolution than natural selection or RM&amp;NS alone, and it is why we talk about the Neodarwinian Synthesis and Modern Evolutionary Theory. HGT validates the modern ToE. Modern evolutionary theory incorporates Darwin's version, and lot's more. HGT is part of the  lots more .  Some versions of lateral gene transfer have been accepted and studied for many decades, notably versions of conjugation in bacteria. (It wasn't until biologists were able to start sequencing DNA in quantity that we were able to see all the retroviral DNA segments and so forth.)  When someone like Gould (for example) talks about Darwinian evolution, depending on context, they are talking about either 1) the historical early version of the ToE as Darwin envisaged it, 2) the position that natural selection is the dominant process in evolution, or 3) an instance of evolutionary change in which natural selection is inferred to have been by far the most significant process. Evolution has moved well beyond Darwin's initial ideas to include mutations, recombination, and genetic drift, including HGT, in all sorts of combinations with each other and with natural selection.  As Chemist says, once HGT has occurred, the new version with the new genes can easily find itself competing with the old version, providing another way that NS can be involved, but it doesn't have to be. NS is just not all there is to evolution.  I can't wait to see how you are going to misinterpret this next.

As written,  Godlessness; immorality , implies that immorality is synonymous with godlessness but the thesaurus entry for godlessness does not list immorality as a synonym.

I'm sure you've seen this in all sorts of different fields, it's just most pronounced when someone is denying facts, rather than refuting an opinion. If someone is devoutly religious, and firmly believes in a literal interpretation of the Bible, then facts which contradict that belief simply don't take hold.

Under your argument, the conclusion is God is a liar.   So God deceived us by creating a system that today works as we know it in a way that refutes Literal Creationism and has absolutely no evidence of being different at any time in the past but secretly made the named light sources abide to his secondary set of physical laws which he then removed from creation without a trace.

Strict Creationists came to the conclusion that the Bible was literally true before they were presented with the evidence that it cannot be so.  Entirely not so. The evidence supporting Creationism is the Bible, written by man, bought and sold in many languages all over the world. The evidence supporting evolution is piled up in museums and institutional collections all over the world. The only evidence that the Creationists are right is that someone said so and we wrote it down. The evidence of evolution is here to touch, study, age-date and ponder. The 6000 year old earth story has been debunked.  Maybe that's your biggest problem, thinking that they're totally opposite. The only thing that messes up the Biblical pie is the time line and our interpretation of how God works.  Understanding what we know now about orbital physics and why space things are almost always spherical in shape, it's laughable to think that the Earth was here before the Sun. Remember, you are reading from things written before man figured out that the Earth is not flat.  No, the Sun was before the Earth, the Earth before the Moon and the tides before intelligent life.  You can take that to the bank!

Change is not something eagerly embraced by a majority of the general public under normal circumstances, actually quite the opposite, and these trying times would increase their desire to hold established values representing better times in a higher light than if times were prosperous and stable.

He never used the phrase  survival of the fittest  without also making a reference to natural selection. The opposite is not the case.

Notice the mother has no say in the matter, just the husband who decides the price of the fetus.  The Psalms you quoted is not clear about the subject. It talks about God making the author, not about when he became a human being. And Psalms 22:10 implies that God was his God from the time he was born.  I&#8217;m not sure where Gentiles is in the Bible but the verse you quoted again does not state when someone becomes a human being.  The Bible is not filled with quotes about humanity in the womb. There are a few references about a fetus but nothing that states when a human being begins. Even if you believe you become a human being before birth, the question is, at what point?  You state that a fetus must be a human being. And why, well because you think it must be.  Your last argument is that it must be a human being because it has a human genetic code.

As Richard Dawkins would explain, they tend to become adapted to a particular nich in a particular environment, and when that environment undergoes rapid change, they go extinct.

The bottom line is that the DNA code is universal with only a few minor differences in a limited number of primative organisms.  That isn't apparent from the abstract. And I'm not in a position to  purchase  the full article.  Right. We don't know. But it does appear from the universality of the genetic code that all life had a common ancestor. Of course, since you understand evolutionary theory, you are aware that the common ancestor is a population of reproducing organisms.  Exactly. What are you debating? Are you arguing that several identical genetic codes arose more than once?  I'm not sure of your point. So the first  event of compartmentalisiation  went extinct because of excessive ultraviolet exposure or the like. No one is claiming that the first reproducing molecule is the origin of all life.

Authors John Sorenson, Robert Wrinkle, Victoria Brewer, and James Marquart examined executions in Texas between 1984 and 1997. They speculated that if a deterrent effect were to exist, it would be found in Texas because of the high number of death sentences and executions within the state. Using patterns in executions across the study period and the relatively steady rate of murders in Texas, the authors found no evidence of a deterrent effect. The study concluded that the number of executions was unrelated to murder rates in general, and that the number of executions was unrelated to felony rates. (45 Crime and Delinquency 481-93 (1999)).  Deterrence, Brutalization, and the Death Penalty: Another Examination of OklahomaÃâ¢s Return to Capital Punishment. In this study, author William Bailey speculated that if executions had a deterrent effect in Oklahoma, it would be observable by comparing murder rates and rates of sub-types of murder, such as felony-murder, stranger robbery-related killings, stranger non-felony murder, and argument-related killings, before and after the resumption of executions. Bailey examined the period between 1989 and 1991 for total killings and sub-types of killing. After controlling for a number of variables, Bailey found that there was no evidence for a deterrent effect. He did, however, find that there was a significant increase in stranger killings and non-felony stranger killings after Oklahoma resumed executions after a 25-year moratorium. (36 Criminology 711-33 (1998)).

From this he concluded that natural selection operated to change the heritable traits exhibited by populations, and extended this to resulting in large changes over long times. Changes sufficient to result in new species which were reproductively isolated or nearly so.

Basicly that is because many of the assumptions and predictions marxism made has since been falsefied and I have yet to see any rendition of the theories of old into anything useful.  I find Communism, as a state-less utopia based on solidarity and community, void of property ownership and class conflict a beutiful idea. But I don`t think it can be achieved through pursuing the socialistic state of pure governmental ownership of the means of production. In fact, I`m quite sceptic that it ever can be achieved (regardless of how you pursue it)  I find the stalinist and maoist attempts to interpret marxism and apply it to the real world one of the largest attrocities commited throughout modern history. Not only to the hundreds of thousands in the Gulabs and chinese prisons or the millions of victims of starvation or political violence, but also to all of those who actually believed in the proletarian revulotion and where sourly dissapointed when they found themselves slavering in the iron-mines i Kaukasus or working in the rice-fields with a gun-barrel as the only motivation for working harder.  I find Socialism, as a practice of democratic ownership of means of production and re-distribution of resources from the more productive or wealthy to the less productive and poor as a good tool to build a succesful society. But as with any tool, it shouldn`t be used in every situation, but only when and where appropriate. When using the tool of socialism, you are most often distorting the effects of the other tools of market forces.

The projected costs of the system must be weighed against the potential to reduce the enormous social and economic costs associated with gun violence. Eighty lives per day?almost 29,000 per year?are lost to gun violence in the United States.16 The social costs of gun violence in the United States have been estimated to be an extraordinary $100 billion per year.17 If ballistic fingerprinting laws result in significant reductions in gun violence? by strengthening law enforcement efforts to identify and prosecute violent offenders and deterring illegal gun use by and transfers to criminals and youth?the investment will be well worth it.  Also,  -In 1994, the lifetime medical costs associated with firearm injuries and deaths totaled $2.3 billion.  - Approximately 49% of the costs of gun-related injuries and deaths is paid by the public.  -The hospitalization costs associated with firearm-related injuries in 1997 exceeded $800 million.  -Thirty percent (30%) of hospitalized patients were uninsured, and an additional 30% were enrolled in government health insurance programs.  -The direct costs (e.g., medical, productivity) and social costs (e.g., quality of life, emotional) of gun violence are an estimated $100 billion per year  Like I have, said, it seems that perhaps not enough research has been done, to figure out precisely what the program will cost, and how how effective it would be.

4forums_10138	fact-4forums-boot1	Well, here is the article from the BBC yesterday. That article puts it here.  Eusthenopteron -> Panderichthyes -> Tiktaalik -> Acanthostega -> Ichthyostega  There are other examples of transitionals in the gap where they have placed Tiktaalik. From the age (383 million years), it would have fit in to the sequence like this. Panderichthyes -> Tiktaalik -> Elginerpeton -> Ventastega -> Metaxygnathus -> Acanthostega -> Ichthyostega  Of course I do not mean to imply that any of these is ancestral to any other. Venastega, for example, is more primative in form that Acanthostega, and something like Venastega would be expected in the transitional sequence. However, it was almost contemproaneous with Acanthostega.  And I'm not sure where to put Pederpes finneyae. It is apparently not as old as Tiktaalik. It would also date to the same period between Panderichthys and Acanthostega known as Romer's Gap.  Per Ahlberg posted a  hint  about Tiktaalik on the IIDB evolution board on March 30.

No one has developed a complete model of the universe that can describe all observations. That doesn't make the model completely false, it just makes it incomplete.  Back in the day, Newtonian physics was dominant. Then came Einstein's Theory of General Relativity (which is fascinating in discovering that space and time are one thing), and the Big Bang Theory which developed on top of that. There are problems with General Relativity, which breaks down the closer the model gets to the actual moments of the beginning of the universe.  I'm going to say it again: the model isn't wrong, its incomplete. Models get replaced by better models that better fit our observations.  Big Bang merely describes the way the universe works, it doesn't make any predictions as to what was responsible for setting these events in motion.

Do you think you have a greater chance of escaping with your life from a criminal that is armed with a knife or a gun?   From Dr. Roth's study: The overall fatality rate in gun robberies is an estimated 4 per 1,000--about 3 times the rate for knife robberies, 10 times the rate for robberies with other weapons, and 20 times the rate for robberies by unarmed offenders. (Cook, Philip J., 'Robbery Violence,' Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology, 78-2, (1987):357-376.) For assaults, a crime which includes threats, the most widely cited estimate of the fatality rate is derived from a 1968 analysis of assaults and homicides committed in Chicago. The study, prepared for the National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence, reported that gun attacks kill 12.2 percent of their intended victims. This is about 5 times as often as in attacks with knives, the second most deadly weapon used in violent crimes.   http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~zj5j-gttl/guns.htm

Theory: A theory is more like a scientific law than a hypothesis. A theory is an explanation of a set of related observations or events based upon proven hypotheses and verified multiple times by detached groups of researchers. One scientist cannot create a theory; he can only create a hypothesis.  In general, both a scientific theory and a scientific law are accepted to be true by the scientific community as a whole. Both are used to make predictions of events. Both are used to advance technology.    Compare that definition to a religion.

4forums_436	fact-4forums-boot1	lol....moths emerged with the correct colors to match their backgrounds. It has nothing at all to do with what moths might get eaten by birds or which don't. They're just like butterflies:  http://unisci.com/stories/20021/0313021.htm  Monteiro noted that the differences in wing patterns differentiate one species of butterfly from another and are used by males and females to determine with which individuals to mate.  They also have been shown to serve an adaptive purpose, as demonstrated by numerous studies focusing on seasonal changes in wing coloration of individuals in a species.  For instance, Monteiro said, the darker wing patterns that show up in butterflies that emerge in the spring serve to warm up the butterfly faster, whereas butterflies that emerge in the summer have lighter colors.   Also, many butterflies that emerge in the wet season in the tropics have large, conspicuous marks on their wings that deflect the attacks of predators while the butterflies are actively finding mates and laying eggs, while the dry-season cohorts are very cryptic, trying to blend in with their environment and not attract any attention from predators until the rains arrive again,  she said.  The authors note that what's not known about wing patterns in butterflies are the genetic mechanisms that result in the great variety of patterns that exist and an understanding of how those mechanisms have evolved through time.  ------------------------------  The pepprered moth story is the biggest myth of all time. moths emerge physiologically according to background, predators and other external conditions:  http://ourfcs.friendscentral.org/mot...yphenism1.html  Many species of moths and butterflies are known to exhibit a seasonal polymorphism, where one form predominates at one time of year and an alternative form occurs in a different season. Some species also show differences in adult size between two seasonal forms. In some cases, the change in seasonal markings has been shown to correlate with temperature; in these instances it is believed that one color form can provide more rapid or effective solar heating through a larger proportion of darker patterns. In other cases, the seasonal forms are believed to be connected to a more effective cryptic ability according to the nature of available background surfaces.

4forums_8998	fact-4forums-boot1	Actually its one of the oldest gun laws on the books.  The Sullivan Act, also known as the Sullivan Law, is a controversial gun control law in New York State. Upon first passage, the Sullivan Act required licenses for New Yorkers to possess firearms small enough to be concealed. Possession of such firearms without a license was a misdemeanor, carrying them was a felony. The possession or carrying of weapons such as brass knuckles, sandbags, blackjacks, bludgeons or bombs was a felony, as was possessing or carrying a dagger,  dangerous knife  or razor  with intent to use the same unlawfully . Named for its primary legislative sponsor, state senator Timothy Sullivan, a notoriously corrupt Tammany Hall politician, it dates to 1911, and is still in force, making it one of the older existing gun control laws in the United States.  Many believe the act was to discriminate against immigrants in New York, particularly Italians, as the first person arrested under the law was mobster Giuseppe Costabile. Whether this was part of the law's intent, it was passed on a wave of anti-immigrant rhetoric as a measure to disarm an alleged criminal element. The police granted the licenses, and could easily discriminate against  undesirable  elements. Sponsor  Big Tim  Sullivan reputedly desired the law so that his criminal cohorts could go about their activities unimpeded by citizens defending themselves with concealed handguns. It was used against political enemies by dropping a small pistol into an overcoat pocket. Thus having them arrested and put in jail for violation. Big Tim stepped in front of a speeding subway train.

I think your theory too simple. Guns make it easier to kill people. Do you think you have a greater chance of escaping with your life from a criminal that is armed with a knife or a gun?   From Dr. Roth's study: The overall fatality rate in gun robberies is an estimated 4 per 1,000--about 3 times the rate for knife robberies, 10 times the rate for robberies with other weapons, and 20 times the rate for robberies by unarmed offenders. (Cook, Philip J., 'Robbery Violence,' Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology, 78-2, (1987):357-376.) For assaults, a crime which includes threats, the most widely cited estimate of the fatality rate is derived from a 1968 analysis of assaults and homicides committed in Chicago. The study, prepared for the National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence, reported that gun attacks kill 12.2 percent of their intended victims. This is about 5 times as often as in attacks with knives, the second most deadly weapon used in violent crimes.   http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~zj5j-gttl/guns.htm  Some facts you may find interesting:   Crime in England and Wales remains stable and the chances of being a victim of crime are still the lowest in more than twenty years, according to the first quarterly crime update published today by the Home Office.....  British Crime Survey trends since 1997 indicate:  All crime down 27 per cent  Burglary down 39 per cent  Vehicle thefts down 32 per cent  Violence crime down 26 per cent   http://www.policesupers.com/scripts/...SP?news_id=314
4forums_9304	fact-4forums-boot1	The 1995 book, Sex in America, by Gina Kolata, Edward Laumann, and Robert T Michael, which summarizes the results of the last comprehensive nationwide sex survey in this country, reveals that as many as a fifth of the women surveyed practiced anal sex. (The Kinsey Institute New Report on Sex (1991) puts the percentage even higher.)  I think it's logical to assume that the overwhelming majority of these women were neither lesbians nor performing the act by themselves, but with male partners. The figure can therefore safely be extended to the population at large, give or take a few percentage points.  Given that most conservative estimates place the entire gay population of the U.S. at 3-5% (some ultra-right groups place it even lower), taken with the uncontestable facts that 1) few lesbians indulge in penetrative anal sex, and 2) a significant portion of gay men don't either, it becomes clear that, in raw numbers, the number of heterosexuals who are having anal sex far surpasses the number of gay people doing the same.

We know that many evolutionists hold to the idea that we evolved over eons of years from  simple  organisms that eventually evolved from a bacterium. This leads us in to ask the question, where did that bacterium come from? Evolutionists say it was spontaneously produced by a lightning strike in some primeval sea. We can then ask, where did the Earth come from and where did the Solar System come from? To which we are told everything was formed as a result of the big bang about 13 billion years ago, give or take a few billion years.  You may choose to prove any one of these three events is scientific in response to the original topic. The mutations and natural selections and changes we see in animals today is not an area for debate as creationists and evolutionists are in complete agreence over these events as they can be tested and observed. The area in which we have debate is the interpretation about the origins of the scientific evidence, for example, the fossils, animals and plants, planets, rocks and so on.

Elevated mutation rates were experienced by less than a fifth of the adapted bacteria. In addition, the rate in that subpopulation was elevated as a coincidental byproduct of gene duplication (a mutagenic promoter being co-located with the gene that conferred a reproductive advantage), and did not itself confer any benefit. The other 4/5ths of the bacteria which possessed duplicate lac- genes at the time of plating accumulated additional mutations at normal rates, including additional duplicate lac- genes at the same random-chance-per-division rate as they had prior to the selective environment being imposed. The rate of reversion to lac+ was also the same, on a per-gene basis, as in the absence of the selective environment; only the large numbers of lac- duplicates in the selected-for adaptive mutants made it more likely that one of them would revert.  In short, the organismic response you say makes the whole process intentional and systematic simply didn't happen, not here anyway. Neither the directed mutation, nor the subpopulation hypermutation hypotheses fit the facts.

CAT scans of the inner ear of HH showed that the semi-circular cannals, which determine balance and locomotion, are more like those of baboons than those of humans. This is not what one would expect if the evolutionary story about human origins is true, HH should be more bipedal than the Lucy type skeleton from which it supposedly evolved from, but it is not. In fact, most scientists now think that HH is not one creature, but instead is several types of creatures that do not belong together, at least three or more different animals, hence making it an invalid category. Further more, it cannot be our ancestor as no such animal ever existed.  Hence, the evidence is interpreted more sensibly and reasonable through a creationary model.

4forums_206	fact-4forums-boot1	MUSCARELLO v. UNITED STATES  Now consider a different, somewhat special meaning of the word ÃâcarryÃâÃâa meaning upon which the linguistic arguments of petitioners and the dissent must rest. The Oxford English DictionaryÃâs twenty-sixth definition of ÃâcarryÃâ is Ãâbear, wear, hold up, or sustain, as one moves about; habitually to bear about with one.Ãâ 2 Oxford English Dictionary, supra, at 921. WebsterÃâs defines ÃâcarryÃâ as Ãâto move while supporting,Ãâ not just in a vehicle, but also Ãâin oneÃâs hands or arms.Ãâ WebsterÃâs Third New International Dictionary, supra, at 343. And BlackÃâs Law Dictionary defines the entire phrase Ãâcarry arms or weaponsÃâ as  ÃâTo wear, bear or carry them upon the person or in the clothing or in a pocket, for the purpose of use, or for the purpose of being armed and ready for offensive or defensive action in case of a conflict with another person.Ãâ BlackÃâs Law Dictionary 214 (6th ed. 1990).  These special definitions, however, do not purport to limit the Ãâcarrying of armsÃâ to the circumstances they describe. No one doubts that one who bears arms on his person Ãâcarries a weapon.Ãâ But to say that is not to deny that one may also Ãâcarry a weaponÃâ tied to the saddle of a horse or placed in a bag in a car.  Nor is there any linguistic reason to think that Congress intended to limit the word ÃâcarriesÃâ in the statute to any of these special definitions. To the contrary, all these special definitions embody a form of an important, but secondary, meaning of Ãâcarry,Ãâ a meaning that suggests support rather than movement or transportation, as when, for example, a column ÃâcarriesÃâ the weight of an arch. 2 Oxford English Dictionary, supra, at 919, 921.

Or should you wait until I'm a senile 80 year old to minimize the immorality of killing me? Should you wait until I am daydreaming or asleep since I am less a person at those moments?  Second, humans vary from person to person, and even person to animal. Is it moral to kill a person in a coma, a little immoral to kill a retarded person, and the gravest evil to kill a genius?

4forums_7848	fact-4forums-boot1	Sartre, you know little of history.  Until relatively recently within the history of humankind, the Romans adhered to the rule of paterfamilia in which the supreme patriarch of a clan--oh, how they loved their males, men were next to God in their eyes, a tradition which lives on within the Roman Catholic Church--ruled on the existence of infants within his clan. If he chose, this next to God male, the infant lived and received shelter and nurturance. If he chose not, the child was abandoned to sate the hunger of wild animals or, perhaps, might be saved by a kindly human wayfarer. In many cases these wayfarers were not so kind and the child may have been severely abused, used as a sexual toy--hmmm, kind of reminds me of the situation for inner city children in very Roman Catholic Brazil. Interesting.

4forums_8748	fact-4forums-boot1	First of all why would you want to know if I have an alternative theory to one that is known to be false ? Are you found of false theories?  A true theory would be a replacement not an alternative.  The Wrong Answer Will Always Be The Wrong Answer!  If evolution was true there would be overwhelming , uncontestable evidence, there is no uncontestable evidence. Little that is any more than pure imagination.  Theories start out as hypothesis and are then subject to experimentation and observation. When they fail they are discarded. For instance spontaneous generation was disproved by Pasteur and discarded as a theory.  Evolution which is not a theory ,although it is called one ,has been falsified nine ways to Sunday. Two of Darwin's own falsifications have come to pass and ignored. The Galopagos Finches have proven to interbreed which destoys a great deal of the so called basis of his theory.  Extinct  animals and plants are found alive and ignored as evidence against evolution. Theories are made to be challenged but evidence against evolution is suppressed.  Evolutionist had to revive spontaneous generation although it is scientifically impossible because without it atheism is impossible. The atheist must have a story no matter how bizzare to justify his faith . Science suffers because of this.  My theory is that this planet is exactly what Einstein said it was , a place designed by a Supreme Being to be inhabited by people.  The evidence is creation itself. If there is a creation there must be a Creator.  Nothing has ever been observed to self assemble and there is no known process that could accomplish that.  Animals and plants just like the ones alive today have always existed. Many have gone extinct but death is not evidence of evolution.  Human beings are incapable of creating a grain of sand from nothing.  There are grains of sand so there is an intelligence greator than ours that did.  The perfect balance seen in the anthropic principle tells of a Creator.  The unbelievable complexity of the human body makes evolution impossible.  DNA can not exist without proteins. Proteins are coded by the information in the DNA molecule. They had to come into being simultaneously.  Pre-biotic natural selection is impossible , there is no process to affect the evolution of DNA outside of a living organism.  To look at a building is to have absolute empirical proof there was a builder.  To look at creation and say there was no Creator is to enter an intellectually free zone.

4forums_6448	fact-4forums-boot1	Inference is part of the scientific method -- probably the most important part, at that. Without it we would discover nothing, for we can prove very little to begin with. Bear in mind that  proof  is an extremely high standard. Proof is the level at which a proposition's truth value is necessary (ex: given how we define  two,  it is impossible for  two  to not be  one  plus  one ). Inference on the other hand is the only option outside of mathematics. With that in mind, the fact that we can't prove much of anything is more or less irrelevant; what we can do is find lots and lots of supporting evidence and safely infer information from it.

The first would be wrong but the second would be right.  To try to make this clearer:  ..... We have a zeroth law of thermodynamics.  ..... We have a first law of thermodynamics.  .....

If his actual statements can be read in that sense, then his claiming to have come up with a fourth law of thermodynamics does not show ignorance, on his part, of their already being 4 laws of thermodynamics.

I think the program makers granted the IDists a remarkably prominent platform on which they could present their views- which they did with a typical evasion of their religious motivations by avoiding any reference to Christianity and trying to present themselves in the guise of scientists (which is true for Behe but not the others.)  Countering their contributions were Dawkins, Attenborough and Miller. Dawkins was typically dismissive of the validity of ID and to the point about the intelletual dangers it poses, Miller countered the arguements of irreduable complexity and the alleged mathematical improbability of evolution and Attenborough made some more reservedl but no less powerful observations on the true nature of the fundementalists agenda.  This was against the backdrop of material on the Dover trial and some stuff on the Vatican's outlook on ID. As often happens with a popular science program examining a contentious issue very little science was examined at all, which is a shame as it is through such analysis that ID is exposed as the pseudo-science it truely is. Also, while the program tried to be impartial it gave considerable interview time to the ID group which failed to convey the weight of opinion against them in mainstream science.  Overall an interesting watch, but a bit of a PR coup for the IDists, IMO.

4forums_3322	fact-4forums-boot1	 In 1993 a Swiss professor, Martin Killias, published a study of 18 countries concerning gun ownership, homicide and suicide. He in part concluded there was a weak correlation between total homicide and gun ownership. For a partial criticism of his study see Dunblane Misled where using the countries studied by Killias, these researchers found a much stronger correlation between firearm homicides and car ownership. More seriously, when the United States was included in the Killias study, a stronger correlation between total homicide and gun ownership was found. When two countries were excluded, the U.S. (high gun ownership, high murder rate) and Northern Ireland (low gun ownership, high murder rate) the correlation was marginally significant. Gary Kleck writes,  Contrary to his claim that 'the overall correlation is not contingent upon a few countries with extreme scores on the dependent and independent variable', reanalysis of the data reveals that if one excludes only the United States from the sample there is no significant association between gun ownership and the total homicide rate.  (Kleck, Targeting Guns: Firearms and Their Control, p 253. Walter de Gruyter, Inc. New York, 1997.) Kleck concludes that  the homicide-guns study was not international at all, but merely reflected the unique status of the United States as a high-gun ownership/high-violence nation...Since the positive association Killias observed was entirely dependent on the U.S. case, where self-defense is a common reason for gun ownership, this supports the conclusion that the association was attributable to the impact of the homicide rates on gun levels.

For something to be hot enough to explode faster than the speed of light, it would have to be larger than our minds can comprehend.] Eventually, all of the matter in the universe will again be compressed into a infinitesimal speck. [We know that the universe is expanding outward. It cannot possibly expand from light years to something smaller than an atom.] When the universe was a dot, it spun clockwise faster and faster until it exploded. [The Law of Angular Momentum states that if an object breaks apart in a frictionless environment, then the fragments will all spin the same direction. Yet if the universe started out as a spinning speck and exploded, then how is it that the universe is filled with exceptions where moons, planets, and even whole galaxies are spinning backwards?] To sum it all up, the Big Bang Theory states that 'nothing exploded and here we are!'
4forums_4328	fact-4forums-boot1	No, the logical explanation was already worked out by scientists several decades ago.  RNA was theorized to be able to perform both informational and catalytic ability, thus serving the biological roles of both DNA (information storage) and proteins (biocatalysts). The theory was confirmed, I believe in the early 1980s, when ribozymes - catalytic RNAs - were disovered. And since then, scientists have been able to evolve in the lab a ribozyme that is capable of copying part of its own sequence. They are getting close to confirming the theory that an RNA molecule can serve as the information store and the catalytic machinery for its own replication.

The moment you invoke the supernatural as a reason for a natural event is when the science has stopped- for example intelligent design will go some way with the empirical and then flip to the supernatural at the last hurdle. ID would say this is the eye, its structure has evolved through organism x->y->z we see in the fossil record and then say God directly shaped this design as it is too complex to have happened by chance, whereas science will say the eye was a response to a natural evolutionary pressure say from predation, environment and so on and is a product of natural selection.  The latter view here could be reconcilled in a number of ways with a religious beief, but the former can never be reconcilled with science.

4forums_8067	fact-4forums-boot1	I think reason why the  hypothesis validated  card has been played here is because:  1. The time window for the expected transitional form is about ~20 ma, a narrow window by geological timeframes. Given this the researchers examined the stratigraphic column to select locatities where the rocks were of the corresponding age and selected sites accordingly.  2. Tiktaalik was expected to live in a certain type of environment, and this expectation was used to further narrow the localities that would be explored as potential deposits for containing the expected  transitional  form.  3. Having selected the locality, expeditions were mounted and successfully recovered remains of the anticipated beastie. Upon analysis it was found to lie in terms of evolutionary development between the most derived/advanced fish and most primitive tetrapods that had been previously known.  Given the huge expanse of the Earth's surface 1 and 2 helped the researchers select comparitively tiny areas to examine and the fact they found what they (roughly) expected to find says their hypothesis (we will find remains of transitional form x at locality y) was borne out. If no remains had been found then further expeditions might have been successful and the hypothesis could of been validiated at a later date. If they had found, lets say a more primitive form than the previously most advanced fish or a more advanced tetrapod than the previously most primitive form then I think that might amount to a falsifiaction.  Having said all that I think that to claim a hypothesis was validated in this instance is slightly confusing as palaeontology is like archeology- you can never be 100% sure everthing has been found and one small discovery can force a rethink of what that had been established up to that point. Also, IIRC, none of the three articles in nature make any reference to a hypothesis being validated  I'd describe it more as being an expectation being fufilled.

However, the AIG does list Thomas Barnes who's highest earned degree is an MS in physics, his Sc.D being honorary from his undergraduate, Christian university. Clifford Burdick has a  degree  from a non-university (as described in the mimeographed bulletin of the  University of Physical Sciences , from which Burdick claimed his degree:  'The University is not an educational institution, but a society of individuals of common interest for the advancement of physical science. There are no campus, professors or tuition fee. ). Harold Slusher has an honorary degree from a Bible college with only a 1/2 man graduate science department in addition to his  degree  from Columbia Pacific University a non-accredited correspondence school that promises a degree in less than a year. I do note that Clifford Burdick is listed on list of deceased scientists who believed in a creator.  I presume that the rest of the  scientists  listed by AIG actually have the PhDs that AIG claims of all 182 listed.  I invite you to compare that list to the Steve list, now at 720+ scientists named Steve who accept evolution as the correct explanation for the observed diversity of life. The name  Steve  (and variations thereof) comprises about 1% of the population. The percentage of qualified scientists with that name cannot be far from the norm. The Steve list was initially composed of scientists with PhD degrees biology, geology, paleontology, or a related scientific field. However, there are also scientists in fields such as cosmology and astrophysics that are signatories as well as other fields with an interest in evolutionary theory. For example, Stephen Hawking has signed the Steve list.  I invite you to find bogus and inappropriate degrees on the Steve list. I am sure that the NCSE would be appreciative of your efforts. Hopefully you will have a more difficult time than I did in identifying bogus degrees.  Oh, yes. In my experience, creationist scientists were always creationist long before they were scientists.

4forums_3656	fact-4forums-boot1	I've examined Hall's papers and they make interesting reading. However, further research, including some undertaken by Hall himself, has informed the debate greatly.  For one thing, many of the experimental results to which Hall originally proposed sub-population hypermutation (your 'hypermutation as a eusocial response') as an explanation have proved inconsistent with that hypothesis. The Amplification Mutation model described above is a much better fit, correctly predicting such details as clonally-related bacteria possessing redundant lac- copies in addition to the lac+ revertant. The articles I've already cited, though they focus on the Cairns system's experimental vulnerabilities as the origin of the recent directed/adaptive mutagenesis misperception, also include Hall's work in their assessment.  Hall himself performed a followup experiment to his work on anomalous rates of trpAB+ dual revertants, acknowledging that a colleague's suggestion, that stochastically-occurring trpA+trpB revertants were growing on waste byproducts secreted by non-growing trpAtrpB+ revertants was probably correct.  In short, though hypermutation of a sub-population does occur sometimes, it is not always an organismic response (eg mutation promoters coincidentally amplified along with useful genes), and the 'successful' mutants do not always, or even mostly, arise from within that subpopulation.  Also, you still seem reluctant to acknowledge the implications of the existence of a physical mechanism for hypermutation under stress. It must itself have evolved somehow - which makes it logically (as well as empirically, as evidenced by my original post in which 4/5ths of the adaptive bacteria exhibited no increased mutation rate) not a prerequisite for evolution. It's just one more adaptation to the environment - in this case, the environment's potential for inducing - though carcinogens or simple uncertainty at the molecular level - genetic change.

4forums_9804	fact-4forums-boot1	And in Daphnia you might want to consder that the specifics are known to some degree as to what compound serves as a signal of predators.  http://plankt.oxfordjournals.org/cgi...tract/fbi142v1  Just in case you are too lazy to read here is a bit of the article.  Daphnia may respond with an array of antipredator defences (behavioral, morphological, life-history) to a chemical cue (kairomone) exuded by its predators: fish and Chaoborus. Given the wide array of potential responses, it is an interesting question whether antipredator defences are coupled or independent of each other. Since antipredator responses are costly and even possessing the genetic information to respond to a certain predator might involve a cost, clones may only react to predators they co-occur with in nature. In this study we provide evidence for an uncoupling of responses by Daphnia pulex in several antipredator defences against Chaoborus. We were unable to detect a correlation between behavioral (migration), morphological (neck-spine induction), and life-history (growth rate, neonate size and size at first reproduction) responses. Furthermore, antipredator responses did not always comply with what is commonly believed. We found that Daphnia clones can migrate up or down when exposed to fish or Chaoborus kairomone, and that population growth rate, neonate size and size at first reproduction can increase or decrease in response to Chaoborus kairomone. We also show patterns in antipredator defences that seem to relate to the habitat from which clones were derived. Daphnia clones that were collected in habitats with Chaoborus as the dominant predator tended to react strongly to Chaoborus kairomone by migrating upward and producing neckspines. The migration behaviour against fish kairomone in these clones was often an unexpected upward migration. The Daphnia clone that co-existed with fish predators showed a downward migration in the presence of fish as well as Chaoborus kairomone. Clones that had occurred with either both or no predators had mixed responses. We sometimes found an upward migration in combination with smaller body size as a response to Chaoborus kairomone. This may be interpreted as a behavioural defence against Chaoborus and a life-history defence against fish. Daphnia seem not to exhibit defence behaviour against predators they do not co-occur with. It might be costly for Daphnia to maintain genetic information to respond to these predators and protect that information from genetic drift.

Abortion on demand is by far more accurate because such a service is vital; not a ?convienence.? Abortion is an crucial sacrament within the fabric of American society; 1 in 4 women will have them but everyone is afraid to admit how much we depend on it. Abortion has always been popular whether it was in the 1700s or 2000s, whether criminal or legal and whether you were against it or not. Americans demand for abortion, not request it. Were black American slaves requesting or demanding freedom?  People who think abortion is a convenience are out of touch with reality and are deeply in denial.
4forums_2158	fact-4forums-boot1	What you are talking about here is the *potential* to exist being important. I would personally also thinking that potential existence is important, but not nearly as important as an existing person. After all, unfertilized eggs and sperm also have the *potential* to become full people but no one is concerned about their loss. For many of us it is the actual mentally-existing person that is most important.  For both the 'braniac  case you present and for the early term fetus, if there is no reason to kill it, then don't.

Thus, a nation such as New Zealand, or Australia, promotes a more 'community-minded' citizen then an 'individualisticlly-minded' citizen. This also carries over into general attitudes towards one's neighbours. In America, you're in fear that what little you have is going to be plundered by blacks or hispanics, or commies or someone.

The word evolution means change. In some situations it still has a meaning that it had back in Victorian times. It meant change in a particular direction, as in stelar evolution - stars  evolve  in predictable ways. It also sometimes carries the connotation of progress. But none of these meanings are applicable to theories of biological evolution. There is no concept of purpose or direction to the word when used in a biological context.  Here is a more precise definition of evolution: evolution is a change in the heritable characteristics of a population of living organisms over generations. When scientist or a knowledgable amateur speaks of the  theory of evolution,  it is this theory that is being discussed. Unmodified, the term has come to mean biological evolution. Those who include the big bang (cosmological evolution) or the formation, life and death of stars (stelar evolution) are either ignorant or dishonest. Even the question of the origin of life is irrelevant. One may postulate a magical, all powerful being that created the first life. The theories of evolution attempt to explain how life changes and has changed over time.

Meanwhile, the god who had originally proposed destroying the world now relents and blesses Utnapishtim and his wife with immortality.  The written version of this story predates the written Judaic tale of Noah. Which isn't to say that the Israelites borrowed the tale consciously or deliberately.

It does no service to the pro-choice lobby to display the sort of attitude that says  we don't value human life . If you think abortion is an acceptable moral choice then you have to make a case either that the fetus is not human, is not an individual, is not alive, or is in some other way not worthy of respect. Or you have to make a case that ending it's life is in some way justifiable in spite of these things.  I am pro-choice, but only because I don't believe you can legislate about an issue like this unless there is near unanimity. The suffering and anguish caused by banning abortion is substantial and should not be dismissed, but equally when abortion is legal it should not be seen as a substitute for contraception.

The bishop instructed me not to take Communion and said that he has instructed the diocesan priests not to give me Communion,  Kennedy told the paper in an interview conducted Friday.

You can jump up and down, and post irrelevant things such as the Dec. of Independance, but it doesn't boost your debate credibility.  -Mach

If you haven't identified it then you are as clueless as IDers are in how we detect manufactured artifacts.  However, IDers have given you a clue. They just ignore it themselves. This is from Behe's Darwin's Black Box:   For a simple artificial object such as a steel rod, the context is often important in concluding design. If you saw the rod outside a steel plant, you would infer design. Suppose however, that you traveled in a rocket ship to a barren alien planet that had never been explored. If you saw dozens of cylindrical steel rods lying on the side of a volcano, you would need more information before you could be sure that alien geological processes -- natural for the planet -- had not produced the rods.

4forums_6812	feel-4forums-boot1	While 'commonly' may or may not be true, this does end up happening at least some of the time (and possibly a lot of the time). It's highly doubtful that clinic workers do this with ill-intent... for example, a woman enters a clinic because she's confused and thinking about getting an abortion... she wants to consider the option of abortion, though she's not really comfortable with the idea. The clinic worker assures the woman that abortion is a painless procedure, and that lasting psychological effects rarely (if ever) occur. The clinic worker may ask the woman to think about how having a child would interfere with the woman's life. I'd encourage you to read the book  Forbidden Grief  by Theresa Burke. It is a fascinating look at real women who have had abortions, and the experiences they have gone through. Some of the women described in the book feel that they were manipulated by clinic workers into having an abortion. (In reality, short of physical force, no one can 'force' you to do something you don't want to do, but things can be said and done to mislead a person --intentionally or otherwise-- into thinking that's what they want themselves.)

4forums_2256	feel-4forums-boot1	As firearms sales in the United States hit new highs, the Obama Administration and Democrats in Congress are squelching talk of a renewal of the assault weapons ban passed by Congress that lapsed in 2004, saying they don't want a distraction from their agenda and don't have the votes in Congress.  Seven million people have applied for criminal background checks since November in an effort to buy guns, according to the FBI. That figure doesn't include Virginia, whose gun shows don't require any background checks.  The buying bonanza has stripped some stores almost bare of assault weapons and yielded a national ammunition shortage.  As gun sales blossom, Democrats' interest in regulating gun sales appear to be waning, despite the recent spate of high-profile gun violence.  Two recent reports have fingered the Obama Administration and the assault weapons ban's most ardent supporter in Congress -- Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) -- as putting off any effort to regulate high-powered weapons. Congressional officials told a reporter in comments published Saturday that Obama and top White House aides have all but abandoned a push for tighter gun control, indicating they can't stomach a fight with the National Rifle Association when they're focused on other issues.   He and other White House strategists have decided they can't afford to tangle with the National Rifle Association at a time when they're pushing other priorities, like economic renewal and health-care reform,  congressional officials said.

4forums_6409	feel-4forums-boot1	I think the problem is, some people believe that gun control, any gun control, is one step closer to the total surrender of all guns. My belief on this is that every time someone calls for repeal of gun control laws or opposes the new gun control laws, it fuels the anti-gun extremists to call for the total ban on all guns. If we cannot make and enforce common sense gun control laws that both sides can agree on, neither side will ever stop. If a buy back was ever proposed in America, very few guns would be sold. If guns were banned all together, only the law abiding people will give up their guns, and anyone who does not will unfortunately become a criminal.

Babies can not survive in the womb without amniotic fluid, and the longer they are in there with fluid leaking, the greater the risks to mother and baby.

To not say yes to all three exposes you as a hypocrite who assigns the label  murder  to a human death as your personal moral whims take your fancy.  Person is a label that is and has been applied differently by different societies through the ages. I personally think it utterly inane to seek to apply the label to a fetus before it is around 3 weeks old for example. The case for applying the label then steadily grows as the fetus grows. Assuming it develops normally, by birth it's definitely deserving of the label.

With only the judicial means, people feel that they have no say whatsoever in something they feel is important.

Anti-abortion legislation is simply a tool by which they try to maintain a less sexually permissive society, believing that if women who fall pregnant outside of marriage are forced to endure pregnancy and likely child-raising alone, rather than being offered an easy way out, they will be less likely to have sex outside of marriage.  For this reason any method of contraception poses the same threat to them as abortion does, though some methods may be easier to rally support against than others.

I think the initial break was there to help raise a family. Until homosexual couples can have children, I don't want to fork that out of my paycheck.  They can legalize these marriages for all I care, but I'm not paying for them, and I'm sure other's don't want to either.  Also, homosexual has all of a sudden started to grow at an alarming rate. It's more than it used to be, and I don't think genetics have anything to do with it. It's learned. So if we keep teaching everyone that it's fine, then sure, we'll have more homosexuals.

My belief on this is that every time someone calls for repeal of gun control laws or opposes the new gun control laws, it fuels the anti-gun extremists to call for the total ban on all guns. If we cannot make and enforce common sense gun control laws that both sides can agree on, neither side will ever stop. If a buy back was ever proposed in America, very few guns would be sold. If guns were banned all together, only the law abiding people will give up their guns, and anyone who does not will unfortunately become a criminal.

As a result, some gun owners feel they always need to have a loaded gun around even if it's endangering their children.  Merely hiding your guns is not enough. Children can find guns that are hidden. I remember staying at my grandfather's house during the summers as a child.

Guns need to be stored under lock and key to prevent children from accessing them. Trigger locks could help too.

If gays were given all of the benefits of marriage for just living together, we wouldn't have a fight at all as you would have gotten what you want. It isn't the marriage that is important to you but the benefits. And the debate in Italy of singles who live together seeking marriage benefits also is a good example of the can of worms that will be opened if society concedes to the gay crusaders the undue rights they are demanding.  Why is it absolutely impossible for you to reply to an issue without first redefining it to fit your warped World view? Have you no objectivity within you at all?

4forums_2616	feel-4forums-boot1	Why is there this onus on the man to do everything? As I said before, it is just as much the woman's choice to have unprotected sex as it is the mans - if this is not the case, then it is already covered by rape laws. By your proposition, only the man need worry about birth control - the woman has no legal necessity to do so at all.  It's not a case that 'the man did the deed' - both parties are potentially just as culpable. If you're going to introduce legal consequences for abortion, they are going to have to affect all the guilty parties; the woman included.  However, personally I would argue against adding further legal restrictions to abortion.

Scientists publish their results in journals.  Their methods and results are there for everyone to see.  All you and I have to do is go to a library that subscribes to the journal, or personally subscribe to it, and look up their work.  If you had a problem with what they did, you can do your own experiments to prove them wrong, or at least make your case why you think they are wrong.  Now, getting your results published is another can of worms.  But, anyway, you or I don't have to be published to redo the experiments ourselves, but that might take some money.  Anyway, all I'm saying is that once something is published, it's not written in stone.  It doesn't become infallible scripture.

feel_1400	feel	Well I'm neither rational nor a theist, but still!  I could put in a comment about what I personally believe the nature of God to be, but I'm sure you've all heard it before so I won't bother!  In the end I don't think it is an easy question to answer, it is asking to define the undefinable. Humans are limited creatures, we can give a dictionary definition of these things, we have a rough idea of the concept of infinity but can never begin to truly comprehend or define it.
feel_109	feel	Cherry picking again.
feel_98	feel	Well nothing, other than the fact that I don't believe it to be true!
feel_135	feel	And we have an emotional post with no substance whatsoever. I'm sure your twin will be checking in soon. I think I'll keep a count of this type of post.
feel_653	feel	I don't see how this is not a debate about abortion. True, it's become mildly less concrete, but that's what happens when you try to get it right.
feel_647	feel	Oh wait, I have...I was a creationist for 18 years of my life. 10 of which I was coherent enough to understand some aspects of science and about 5 of which I understood the more complex ones. I know all the Creationist arguments, I have used them. And I used to be a darn good creationist debater...I could almost convince atheists who just didn't understand enough science to refute me. I had learned evolution in high school. I could repeat the facts, but I didn't believe them. I never argued with high school biology teachers becasue they didn't know enough about it to argue back. Then cam college. I took a course in evolution, because I am a curious and open-minded person. I went to class I took the notes and I talked to my prof. during his office hours. For each of the proofs he gave me, I gave him reasons (creationist arguments) that they weren't proof or that they were wrong, and he was able to easily refute any argument I gave him. I always questioned him and refuted things in the book, but he always refuted mine right back, and he did a better job and used undeniable empirical evidence. (No I am not going to give you any here I have neither the time nor the degree) At this point I was a very confused Christian, I talked to other Christians, I found sites online and then I found a creationist debate site. I asked what they thought and after hearing points from all sides: atheist, hard-core creationist, theistic evolution, self-righteous butt heads. I came to my own conclusion with all the facts that I had. Since then I have seen Kent Hovind speak...and I uh...won't go there. The fact of the matter is...can my belief in an old evolved earth withstand creationist arguments...I would say so. Have I taken classes in Creation...heck yeah. Will I take more in the future...sure if I think they have anything to add to my knowledge. In fact there is a professor at my college who is a creationist and if he ever speaks I will certainly go to hear him. So am I close minded or afraid to learn something new or change my opinion...no. I look to find the truth through facts and knowledge. Because after all when you find truth you find God. So instead of attempting to turn my question back to me, why don't you actually ask yourself...are you afraid to take a detailed class in evolution taught by someone with a PhD...could Creationism stand up to it. I can't answer that question for you, and I can't even tell you whether you should try to find the answer or not, it's your choice. But don't forget, whenever you believe something don't just belive it because someone said so, find out WHY you believe it to make sure that you should
feel_121	feel	Your technicality bs is not needed here...granted you have only made 20 posts or so.
feel_874	feel	But you have challenged science with your beliefs. You argue against science with your beliefs, based on mythology with no evidential support. You argue against real science so that you can cling to your fairy tales.

feel_848	feel	I don't think people have a right to kills themselves (obviously not natural and obviously not legal right now). As for the other question, I wouldn't think a blatent disregard for the others health is morally ok.
feel_1616	feel	So both daughters get daddy ******, shag him and get pregnant. And considering that God smites people for just about anything and everything in the Bible, he seems silently approving in this case.
feel_690	feel	"Translation: ""Shut up, I'm right!"""
feel_1602	feel	I don't give a damn about the circumstances of the unborn either(obvious here I am not saying I don't care what happens to either, but for the sake of whether or not we should kill the unborn this is my stance). Neither one should have a right to kill the other...and for that matter, no one else should be allowed to come up and murder the women or the unborn. So my views are still treating them as equals.  and I will ask you to stay away from more assumtions that you can't prove.
feel_684	feel	It works, because we live in a messed up world. In the US, restricting ideas is what doesn't work.
feel_67	feel	So now you're freely and willingly admitting that you'd take pleasure in inflicting pain and suffering on innocent people who have never done anything to you?      Good God! No wonder you don't like guns and want to see everyone disarmed!

feel_727	feel	And I see you still flip back and fourth from being an atheist to not being an atheist.
feel_733	feel	Hey, dont give religion on public schools credit. At least crack tastes good.
feel_1038	feel	To be honest I wouldn't mind too much missing old age...(whenever that starts).
feel_900	feel	I think many things are getting confused here.  First, I have no idea what âmoral maturityâ means. You talk as though that is some definable entity.  Next, one may reasonably consider that children are cognitively different from adults. Despite what society or 5 judges have to say, that seems to me a valid reason for applying different sentences to different people.  The question was raised with respect to the death penalty as well. We are not talking about criteria for guilt, but once convicted, we are talking about whether to execute a person or not. Unless you feel that punishment should be based solely on retribution, I think there is some wiggle room for different sentencing guidelines for different aged humans.   You have conceded that a difference in neurophysiologic fitness makes sense, but we should decide on a case by case basis. If you can figure out a reliable way to do that, go for it.   We draw the line based upon age all the time for all sorts of things.  The issue of abortion is different for many reasons. We are not deciding on whether to execute a person based upon a crime they committed. That makes it a different issue. Ideally, we would never have a pregnant young woman under the age of 18 make a decision like that without the support and guidance of her loving parents. The ideal situation sometimes does not exist. An underage female may legally make this decision precisely because there are many out there who do not have that guidance at all or informing parents would make things worse. It just so happens that females are fertile prior to 18, so we do not have the luxury of applying similar age requirements. If you could ban pregnancy prior to 18, now youâd be talking.
feel_914	feel	but you too are a figment of my imagination, and you only think you are a giant alien dreaming about this world because i imagined you as such. you cannot disprove this either.
feel_1004	feel	I still think there would be thousands of women taking the pill that aborts fetuses every year. I would expect several hundred to be caught.

How many kids drowned in 5 gallon buckets between your two posts? How many in car wrecks? How many from blunt objects or knives? Actually, death by guns is far down the list so why is it you go bananas when you hear of a shooting even if someone is killed or not? You do understand there are justifiable shootings also?"

feel_257	feel	Well ... that does tend to happen when you waste time arguing the obvious as if it were a rebuttal to anything. Maybe rather than being argumentative to the point of arguing over things that are pointless and that no one disagrees on, you could thoughtfully discuss things that people don't see eye to eye on. You might get better results from people that way.

feel_1562	feel	"I've been around the creationist/science discussions for a number of years, about 20 or so. The ""you believe in evolution"" argument has been around for at least that long. In my experience it has been a waste of breath to try to convince creationists that I don't believe in evolution any more than they do. As I recall, the argument was even presented in a court case back in the late 60s, or maybe it was the early 80s. I could be wrong. I'll have to check on that."

When women kill their tots they are locked up/ and branded with a criminal record vs  the female who callously kills durning the fetal stage.(Double standard?)   I have a couple friends, who have aborted more than once, because they didn't want to lose their girly figure(trivial). I find it eerie and disturbion.....
feel_916	feel	But your proof didn't claim that God could do anything possible. Maybe only one person could build a computer, maybe one person could make a car, maybe one person could run the mile in under 4 minutes. That doesn't mean that God can do ALL of these things. It means that whoever we define to be the greatest being, we can call him god and thus he exists. Of course this wouldn't be sufficient to Christians as this says that God is probably mortal and has the limits of being a physical being.
feel_725	feel	And the Violence Policy Center is somehow more trustworthy?
feel_731	feel	So evolution is anti-Biblical? Yet at other times, your interchangeability allows you to say that evolution is not atheistic. Your clear interchangeability is what really causes me problems, but I can handle it. emoticon_xangel

feel_686	feel	And the fact that you can't understand why it was rejected is whose fault?
feel_1600	feel	I see that you fail to see the logic that the less dominant Siamese twin ALSO has a right to their own body. One is not supporting the other - they are supporting each other so their rights are equal. Besides, both have a mental existence so, at least for me, abortion (or, in this case, one being killed for the rights to body of the other) would not be allowed.
feel_1628	feel	Not much of anything else either, it would seem.
feel_876	feel	I think that's the first thing you've said (in this forum) that I agree with. Not only that, but belief in God is illogical.

feel_1370	feel	And the only reason the criminals hold handguns is because of the ban.
feel_1416	feel	But that is your goal whether you want to admit it or not. And that is your sole way of defending creationism as you have admitted you cannot argue creationism based on its own merits. Creationism is wrong independent of Evolution. Even if you somehow manage to disprove evolution (along with every science) you still have to even take a single step towards proving Creationism.
feel_490	feel	um, yeah, you could say that... (won't argue... left up to the evolution board)
feel_1402	feel	Why should we listen to you when you don't listen to us?
feel_484	feel	no, you just live on delusions.      you can't argue the merits of creationism on their own because they don't exist.       Creationism is a fraud regardless of the existance of evolution.
feel_1364	feel	YOU ARE WONDERFUL!
feel_1358	feel	Yes. Little.
feel_335	feel	Not historical documents but mythology. Genesis isn't historical. To believe that it is takes a certain intentional ignorance of the universe.
feel_453	feel	Well, evolution by natural selection makes things look as if they were designed for the environment in which they live. I don't presume to give God instructions on how he should go about His work. I only observe it.

feel_1007	feel	But stress a child, it would be wrong to judge a child by the circumstances of its birth but as a developing embryo I do not think it can be treated the same way. Adoption may be preferable if possible but if someone is causing harm, albeit even unintentionally they are still responsible. The whole idea of manslaughter is based around this, without even going on to criminals being a product of their environment - they may have had apparently little choice in their crimes. This does not exempt them from punishment though - they serve to prevent future crimes or to stop the contining harm being caused.

What's greater is that they opened themselves to ridicule: he's a good source when his statements can be edited and removed from context, but FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DON'T LET HIM SEE THE MOVIE!
feel_1229	feel	You mental midgets insult my intelligence when you aren't even aware that the word omnibenevolent isn't even found in the Catholic Online - Catholic Encyclopedia . In fact, the word isn't found in any popular dictionary what so ever. It's an urban slang with no historical usage in theological studies or history at all. I ought to know, because it never came up in Bible College, ever. But here it is in the famous and highly referred to URBAN DICTIONARY: Urban Dictionary: omnibenevolent Once again guys, get a clue before you start spouting off your criticisms which you haven't an actual clue about.

feel_287	feel	So why are you here? Do you have anything to offer of any substance?
feel_1215	feel	I think it's fair to say that if there was no God, then there would be no gay people...
feel_293	feel	Don't count on it. Republicans do not believe in equality, individual freedom, or human rights. They only kowtow to their religious right masters. If Republicans trully belived in individual freedom, equality, and human rights the would wholeheartedly support this legislation.
feel_1573	feel	Oh, so you were not in any way talking about evolution in these posts? Then why are they posted on the c vs e board?      Please, that's just pathetic.
feel_1598	feel	But because your book of mythology tells you about a week of creation, you prefer that (because it requires less thought) to examining reality.
feel_278	feel	Then what's your justification for wanting to make it harder for good people to have access to firearms? Do you fear something in particular? Or do you just not like how some people choose to exercise their rights and want them curtailed in a way that makes you feel better?
feel_522	feel	So? In your religion's view, everyone sins. Their sin is no greater or more unforgiveable than yours.
feel_244	feel	"This is the ""right"" SCOTUS to hear the case, IMO. ;)"
feel_250	feel	So you use the site to try and make a point and then call the site biased....How confusing.  You then go on to talk about a how making abortion illegal will not reduce abortions (a point I don't really care about) but unrelated to this topic...so if you want to talk about that, start another thread.  So do you still wish to defend Planned Parenthoods fake numbers?
feel_536	feel	"**   I wasn't making a 'point', just an observation. But since you want a 'point', nip back over to ""The Swamp"",[that is, 'Internet Infidels (atheists)DB', and ask Oolon Colophid[sp.?] why he thinks the human appendix makes his 'point'."
feel_907	feel	I never said they would actually follow it all the time. I said that most would incorporate it (referring to a world morality). Just because they would accept it doesn't mean they would follow it. Maybe you should stop trying to tear down your little strawmen.

feel_74	feel	Nothing that prevents it communicating in theory, but I have covered the communication aspect already in this post.   The idea that we are 'image bearers of the divine' comes purely from human religions, and has no concrete basis. The atoms in my body were created by nuclear fusion in the centres of stars that exploded billions of years ago. Rather than being imago dei, we are stardust. I find that idea far more grandiose and appealing than divine providence.  I'm sure you'll have more questions!  Anyone else got more than a trite one-liner on their idea of God (or whatever you think he/she/it is)?

Now I'm not going to make any comments on your ex, or whatever he is to you. Because I don't know him enough to assume anything about him. But I will make general statements on the effects of gay marriages on children.  I have seen so many documents, on teens the are confused about their sexual orintation, because of living i the house with their gay parents. On girl wondered if she was gay because her mother was with another woman. She felt that was normal behavior. And started to concider being with girls herself. But was confused when she started to like men. She actually thought that liking men was abnormal. Until others told her it is normal to like men.  A boy had almost the same experience, he did not know if he too should like men, because his father did. Often he would fight back desires for females, because he thought he needed to be with men. Not only that by he was ridculed by classmates because of his father being gay.  Alot of children endure harassment because of living in a house made up of parents of the same sex. Just because it did not happen to your son, dose not mean that it dose not happen. And your experience is only a fraction of 1% of the experiences that children go through because of having gay parents. It is impossible to say that it dose not happen. If it dose not happen to a few, then thats fine. But the majority suffers, and that far outweighs the few that don't suffer because of having gay parents.
feel_60	feel	And I maintain that your belief is dangerous to America and people like you should be deported to less civilized countries so you can truly appreciate what you had.
feel_1163	feel	Well, that's what I was doing too :-)  This was something that flashed into my mind one morning and I ran with it, posting it almost immediately, working through it all as I was typing. It's not something I've spent months on previously and had all possibilities covered: I was wanting others to take a look and see if they found a gaping hole I overlooked.  I've gotten your (tentative) agreement, and no counters that actually refute my reasoning, so I may move on, using this as a premise for my next step in a larger 'logical argument'.
feel_1188	feel	And if a black guy went on a killing spree and murdered 17 white guys and said he was doing the work that he felt Obama wanted him to do, what exactly would that suggest to you?

feel_668	feel	Please stop demonstrating your complete inability to understand evolutionary theory. How is Texas Stadium meaningful in the population of the earth? Do various blimp pilots who soar over Texas Stadium have better sexual success than you? You seem to be a bit of a sad sack.

feel_654	feel	I know there&#8217;s an explanation for everything, that&#8217;s why God isn&#8217;t praised as much as He should be.   I tend to thank Him for all things. It&#8217;s a habit of mine. I just thought that I&#8217;d throw in my 2 cents worth. No harm intende
feel_898	feel	Have you ever had an abortion?
feel_640	feel	So is Jesus, aka God, a liar?  Or was not even one of the millions of believers who prayed for Terri Schiavo's life to be saved really God's child? Gee, I wonder how many people out there are being led by a pastor, priest, or what have you, that prayed but God didn't listen because that religious leader is a fraud? Hmmm, maybe the rape or molestation of young boys, adulty, and so on, by religious leaders is more widespread than anyone could have imagined?!?!?!
feel_126	feel	"And you've been failing miserably, partly because your definition of ""atheism"" is asinine. Even most Christians would disagree with you."

feel_1406	feel	And you are only trying to earn yourself brownie points in hell.
feel_494	feel	Yes, of course the past can never be proven.  But there are indirect ways to determine what happened within a reasonable ball park.  We can assume that our solar system formed merely by matter coalescing by gravity and then behaving the way matter behaves when it's all clumped together by gravity. We can model it on a computer and if we get something that looks like our current solar system then we can say that the model is a good one and the chances that the solar system formed that way are increased. No, sorry, there is no proof, only explanations and models.  * - edit: you know, actually, evidence in the form of experimental results are reviewed, or at least the methods are reviewed, and then if the experiment isn't reproducible then the evidence becomes suspect, so in that light evidence is, sort of, reviewed. Eh, who cares?)
feel_1412	feel	Huh? Please expound how the Gates, the Gettys, the Kennedys, the Hiltons, the Rockafellers dominate the poor with guns. The rich can afford and can legally own them right now.

Please explain that if a common man can store, use, and own modern military weapons as safe or even safer that the state; that he/she should not be allowed to own military weapons.
feel_1374	feel	At what cost? How many civil rights are you willing to give up in the name of a few less murders each year? Are you perfectly willing to be stopped by the police on a block-by-block basis and forced to show identification and traveling papers, all the while the officers on location are pointing their guns right at your head, ready to XXXX you away at the first sign of a twitch or if you display even a hint of hesitation to comply?  How desperately do you crave a police state? How much do you favor a nationwide curfew where violators can be arrested by the police and held without legal counsel for an indefinite period of time? Do you favor the use of physical and mental torture to force convictions even from the innocent?
feel_1348	feel	The atheist needs to explain how something can exist that's not material, cannot be observed, and is absolute.
feel_641	feel	Just a guess on my part. But it's probably one of the only factors that separates our advanced industrialized nation -- as the only one still having the death penalty -- from savage places like Afghanistan, etc.  Having a doctor allows the self-deceptive veneer that a most uncivilized, inhumane act, about to take place, is somehow civilized or humane. And not the bloodthirsty, venomous, purely vengeful thing that it is.  He sounds like a very principled individual to me. With this, yet one more indication that the death penalty system in our country is unsustainable. Not only for moral reasons, but because it is not shown to serve as an effective deterrent, and because the overwhelmed system is not supportable, under our American Constitution, often punishing everyone involved, even the families of victims. (i.e. These cases go on for years and years and years and years. There's no closure for people.)
feel_899	feel	Just don't drop it in the shower!
feel_127	feel	Well here is a christian who supports abortion.  I personally HAVE had an abortion. I had it several years, and while it was an extremely hard and emotional decision, I chose what was best for me. I was engaged (now married), and both my then-fiance and I were on birth control (I was on the pill and he used condoms). Unfortunately, despite those precautions, I became pregnant. We aren't that rich, and both of us our still finishing up our college degrees and are under enormous student loan burden. He supported my decision to abort as neither of us would have anywhere near the time or money to support a baby (hence our use of contraception), and neither of us have taken a full job in our fields yet to be able to provide that money to pay for the loans let alone a child.  I think this is one of the many circumstances in which abortion is absolutely justifiable, especially because I think that except for rare circumstances, abortion should be allowed up to the third trimester (the exceptions would be if the woman's life was in danger, etc. for a later abortion).  As to God not supporting abortion? Rubbish. If you'd like I could give you verses in which he not only supported abortions, but ordered forced abortions through his people (that is if you take the OT as literally true)
feel_133	feel	Over 10,000 signatures of Christian Clergy have been collected, and have endorsed this letter.

feel_1189	feel	Neener neener - is it time to go in from the playground yet?
feel_669	feel	Why is it you assume I'm doing nothing about it? Do you know how many charities I support which serve in Africa? The question is, what are you doing about it since it is only you whom you have complete control of. Think about actually contributing to programs like Doctors without borders rather than question my giving when it has already been proven on multiple threads that it is conservatives who contribute the lions share to charities in this country. All the liberals do is whine, complain and raise taxes so someone else will have to support their pet programs.
feel_1604	feel	Phil S:   Doesn't it get tedious seeing the same creationist arguments rehashed over & over again? Willful ignorance is so irritating. A person has to pray very hard to keep their mind closed to anything they might learn from these debates.

feel_61	feel	uh huh...I'm not buying it.
feel_1176	feel	And you, on the other hand, because you are not educated in science in general, and evolutionary theory (why the quotation marks?) specifically, are qualified to correct those of us who spent years in study of the topic.

Thus, I extended this analogy so that the relationship between gun owners and discrimination and between serial racists and discrimination is the same because the discrimination in both cases is because of ""who they are."" The analogy that I made was not comparing gun owners to serial rapists, but rather, it was comparing the relationship of the two groups with discrimination.  And what is your deal with lunatic fringe leftie? Antigun laws are clearly not a fringe view, or gun control laws would not have been passed in Congress. You can hardly call the views lunatic. I doubt any doctor would agree that a person with liberal views regarding gun control is mentally insane.  My anti-freedom agenda? What the hell are you talking about? Are you an anarchist? That's the only way to have 100% freedom. The fact that government exists means that there are restrictions. So unless you are an anarchist, I can call you anti-freedom as much as you call me anti-freedom. The question is the degree to which government should restrict freedoms, and that is not an obvious question to answer.  Can you please explain how my views on gun control reveal that I'm racist.

feel_1174	feel	Oh you little tramp!
feel_119	feel	So in other words, you're saying that somewhere along the lines, God changed his mind.
feel_88	feel	Based on who's opinions? Atheist.com and christianssuck.com?
feel_125	feel	"Well I suppose I could've always put up a sign that said ""Trespassers will be held with legal counsel, robbers will be shot, survivors will be shot again"" but you're just welcoming trouble with that."
feel_643	feel	I dont think I have heard a more pathtic excuse for a long time.  All but a few of my colleagues could get into work during the very worst of the weather..why? because they didnt get paid otherwise.  There needs only be a tiny amount of snow for UK teachers to stay away in droves...what a joke!  Strangely enough when I went to school both the pupils and the teachers seem to manage to get to school in the snow.
feel_657	feel	"You mentioned him once or twice. I could give a rats a$$ about him. My concern is for you or anyone else who is in your situation. If you end up getting shot, as you walk towards that light remember you had ample opportunity to have prevented the dire mess you may find yourself in! It was not the guns fault, heck it really was not your brothers fault... It would have been your fault because you failed to act. This line has nothing to do with my position on guns or trying to get a ""one up"" on the debate. You are in a dire LIFE THREATENING emergency much worse than me owning every mortar, grenade, f16, m16, ak-47 in the world. Do you get it?"
feel_131	feel	"So Starguy since you are obviously afraid of guns and won't go near, you don't have to worry about any""violent testosterone's"" but if you want to be friendlier    well you know how to do it. OUCH.emoticon_smile"
feel_1438	feel	You don't say!
feel_1404	feel	my my you are up on the current events. Thanks for shedding light on this for everyone here.
feel_482	feel	These official groups are jokes. Armed citizens are much more effective.
feel_1362	feel	Really? 'cuss what I always see with anti-choicers is that they seem to think that the pregnant woman is invisible. This means that all men and all fetuses have a right to life at all times, but women, for some unknown reason, seem to lose that right when they become pregnant. Weird.
feel_1376	feel	I agree, for the most part. Once you get to tanks and helicopters though? Too big, too easy a target for a tyrannical regime. Do you see the Iraqis and Afghanis using tanks and helicopters? I'm sure they could get them if they really wanted, but they're useless against a government that invests in satellite technology and bombers. Better to stick with the rocket launchers and mines.
feel_1410	feel	Who's this directed at? Me or Ray?
feel_496	feel	"Well, I'm not sure if he consumed alcohol or not, but his doctor gave him daily ""vitamin"" shots that contained vitamins as well as amphetamines and maybe other drugs that doctors at the time thought were mentally beneficial.  And I've never heard of him being a vegetarian.   I saw some show that talked about his voracious apetite, but I don't think they mentioned his being a veggie."
feel_1389	feel	The fear of God? What God? Only yours or any God? How about the fear of something greater than yourself? Would that be progress?  I'm not trying to inform you or anyone else of anything at this time. I posted thread originally to get reactions to it so that I could better judge whether those views were valid or not. As a side affect people may be influenced by the debates that happen here, but I am doing this for myself more than I am for anyone else. So don't think I'm trying to push anyone to believe anything, although I do wish for people to question their own views as a way to best understand what they believe in and why they believe it. Based on the way you posted here, it is my guess you are unwilling to do that in the case presented here.
feel_469	feel	And when are we to expect the birth of the religion of dogs? and of dolphins? of whales and lions?
feel_441	feel	Translation: we let you work and we let you vote, even though you let us down ('This is because of imperfection ...'); so even though 'men are not without blame too', the Fall is mainly your fault, so accept your inferior status and PIPE DOWN!  Now, any guesses as to what organs thinking_person thinks with? Clue: they're not above his waist.
feel_327	feel	How tolerant. Lets talk about the Spanish Inquisition.
feel_333	feel	Well that's a stupid statement. Stupid enough that I can't even wrap my head around it and make a proper comparison.
feel_455	feel	I'm foolishly looking forward to this as if we're going to see anything besides the standard baloney. How silly.      (Yes, I am still alive; I've just been incredibly busy and really hardly have the time even now to check in.)
feel_332	feel	You don't see how gun-control interferes with self-preservatlion?  Hmmmm? OK, simple. I want to defend myself with a handgun. I really can't if I don't have one do I.  Sure you can defend yourself in a gun free society such as Canada. I want to defend myself with a gun when the felons only have knives. I really can't do that if I don't have a gun do I. Your responsible for your own protection, not me.
feel_454	feel	I don't favor abortion but I favor a woman's right to choose abortion.
feel_440	feel	So sorry, Anastasia...that's a horrible thing to face. And now, using that excuse? What!  If justice was swift for the guilty then he would not have escaped only to do it again. Some criminals never change, and via your testimony, only live to do it again.  There are some who need to be put to death.  Your situation made me shudder, Anastasia. But, I am glad you didn't let it (revenge) effect you to the point of taking his life yourself.  If it would have been my father, those many years ago, I cannot say that I would have waited, nor would have accepted that lame excuse of retardation. I could very well be in prison myself.
feel_326	feel	You know something, I just came here to browse, but upon discovering that you feel that people who believe in God are stupid, and their beliefs are stupid, just ###### me off. Not that you dont believe, but your use of the word stupid. I happen to be one of those stupid people you refer to, and so I will say this- People can say or believe whatever they want to, but we are all going to die one day, and something will be waiting on us when we do die, so before you start calling people names, I would explore the possibility that maybe christians are right, because in the inescapable end, we will all find out. And if we as christians are right, your eternal future dont look to good. And one more little thought, people thought the guy who said the world was round was stupid, but he was right in the end.
feel_1388	feel	Well, I haven't mutated into some other species last time I checked.
feel_468	feel	My pursuit of happiness is denied by trees existing. Let's burn them down and destroy the environment. It's much better than me being unhappy.
feel_1377	feel	And well he should have ignored it. Your analogy is nonsense.
feel_497	feel	"Yup. Give me an example of a true inaccuracy, instead of working to poke fun. Do you honestly think anyone will take you seriously (except the evolutionists) if you don't provide reasons for your apparent problem with scriptures. Are you scared because you see the ""ancients"" commenting on subjects you thought science had ""discovered"" since the ""enlightenment""? Man, how arrogant can you get? You remind me of the Pharasees. Arrogant presuppositions are no substitue for confronting your ignorance my friend. Either explain how the Bible speaks accurately on sophisticated subjects as given above, or don't bother posting."
feel_1411	feel	Just amazing.
feel_483	feel	Thank You! I think we will!
feel_1405	feel	Now I have to ask you Mr. and Ms America, Is it old Sarge and Tither the Criminals that you hope our gun laws, and our LEO's will be working this hard to catch? emoticon_xangel
feel_1363	feel	Yeah, all the theologians who've puzzled over this problem for centuries have just been bad Christians in the clutches of atheists.      -sigh-
feel_1439	feel	I think jyoshu has posted a BS meter which is pretty nice.
feel_656	feel	"You know, I'd believe that more if there were people like the Shindler family who have pushed for federal courts to intervene and destroy the sanctity of marriage. There is nothing you could do or say that would convince me that Americans somehow have any respect for marriage whatsoever. What heterosexuals have done to destroy this institution from the inside out only tells me that heteros are simply spoiled children who have the attitude of:  ""If we can't make it work, we aren't going to allow anyone else to come in and do marriage better."""
feel_130	feel	So, then you DO feel that what you did was a sin. Otherwise you wouldn't have asked forgiveness for it.   I have one question. What was your motivation for starting this thread? Was it to try and somehow prove that a person can be a Christian and have an abortion? Just curious. IMO, you are right that you are forgiven for it, as God is a forgiving and loving God. But I hope you don't do it again.
feel_124	feel	So students don't deserve their constitutional rights?
feel_642	feel	But no one ever claimed that they were glued on the trees for any other reason that to show the protective coloration. Why is that a fraud? Wouldn't it be better that you actually learned the facts rather than allowing someone else to dupe you with this misinformation.

feel_695	feel	Damn straight it's irrational.
feel_1175	feel	I'm sorry, but your entire rant is nothing but ignorance based fear mongering. From YOUR ARTICLE:

feel_62	feel	This remains unspecified. (I explained this in the last paragraph)
feel_859	feel	What part of.. 'On the other hand, not one acceptable reason for individuals owning guns is mentioned.' are you having trouble with?  Only a gullible fool, such as yourself, would lend blind allegiance, and obedience, to a 'world' body that seeks to usurp the sovereignty of individual nations.   That's why you are indeed a LIBERAL.

feel_865	feel	As a Christian comfortable with their faith and reality.
feel_722	feel	and a quote from jitobear:
feel_736	feel	You have a lot of choices. My wife had an abortion before we met. My mother also had an abortion when I was about 8. They both have regretted it greatly. Have you considered adoption? There are many many many great couples who cannot have babies that would love to have one and some companies can set you up with those that are willing to pay for the doctors fees and hospital fees etc.  This is indeed traumatic and a difficult choice. It is one I do not wish on anyone. I hope you know some folks you can trust to guide you and to lean on regardless of your decision.  You can still keep it, even though it will be hard, giving life is a wonderful thing.  I would suggest that you consider all angles. Talk with those that lead you both ways. Be wary of anyone who just confirms whatever you say. They are not likely giving you sound wisdom but just want you to like them. Pay attention to those that are secure enough in your relationship with them to speak openly and honestly to you. They may confirm your thoughts they may deny them.  Good luck.  EF
feel_939	feel	well that won't help you when you go to hell...Woo hoo
feel_1001	feel	The VPC has a political agenda. The FBI? That is like saying I believe Coke taste better than Pepsi because the Coke commericial says so.
feel_1015	feel	"Correction: hardly any of them. This is just another lame attempt to use the ""guilt by association"" BS."
feel_905	feel	It stops us from saying we ara a rational people. I don't support any laws that would allow a father not to have a say so about his child being aborted. Are there any?? If it were a life or death thing for the mother no question.  As I stated I don't like the idea but making it illegal would simply put more unwanted kids in state homes. Lets take care of the living first!
feel_1029	feel	And they should. It seems that they are not too bright.
feel_911	feel	"So your answer is to just continue with the way things are now: continue forcing the law-abiding to go unarmed and let only the shooter have exclusive access to guns so they can kill all they want? How many unarmed people have to be killed in a ""gun free zone"" before you come to realize that mandating unarmed and helplessness will do nothing to save even a single life?"
feel_246	feel	I know a miriad of gay couples who would corrupt it signifigantly less than Brittney.
feel_520	feel	BWAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAH. That's good.
feel_534	feel	Then for you, you made the right decision at the time. I'd personally have been leary of not getting to work or go to school easily from the doctors statements, especially in regards to keeping the child.
feel_252	feel	Woman's choice
feel_508	feel	What didn't you learn in that class that we need to teach you?
feel_285	feel	let me try to translate into words  1. if there is a god in this world, there is a god in all worlds  2. there being a god is a possibility  3. If there's a god in all worlds, there's a god in this one  4. There not being a god in all worlds implies that there's isn't a god in any world (all or nothing)  5. There is either a god in all worlds or there isn't a god in all worlds  6. from 4,5 there either is a god in all worlds or no god in any world  7. if there's no god in this world then there's not a god in all worlds  8. There's either a god in all worlds or there is no god in any world.  9. Since god is a possibility we know the statement <there is no god in any world> is false.  10. Since there's a god in all worlds there's a god in this one from 3  Is this the right interpretation? If it is there is one flaw in it. #9 is flawed. Just because there's a possibility of a god doesn't mean that there is a god in some world, just that there's a possibility of him being in some world.
feel_1203	feel	So, you have no problem with the fact that this is abortion and was caused by god?
feel_1565	feel	lol, you know what, I think you were!
feel_1571	feel	And once it has begun, which would you rather have?
feel_291	feel	Hmmm.... your religious predecessors would have sentenced you to house arrest for something so heretical.
feel_1217	feel	Why would they? What would be the purpose? Are you somehow suffering from the delusion that evolutionary biologists try to somehow cause evolution?
feel_1559	feel	According to your logic, an infant would have no right to suck nutrients from a woman's breast. Would you as quickly assert the mother has no duty to care for the infant?
feel_590	feel	"Oh I understand plenty. What you want is a system where a person is held responsible for crimes that they didn't commit. You want ""guilty by association"" extended to the point of ridiculousness where anybody who even met the criminal even once can be held as an accomplice."
feel_1516	feel	Said the troll that lives in the UKemoticon_xdonno
feel_1270	feel	And no, it is not at all clear that this is not about abortion, Phyl, because you keep bringing the topic up. Because you declare something, that doesnât make it so.  Lastly, you are asking the opinions of members of a forum here. If you want our opinions, great. If our opinions differ from some court ruling, it does not mean the opinions are wrong, it means they differ. Given your criterion, the only way to express opinions here would be if we were doing it from the bench.
feel_1264	feel	If the taser led to the death of an innocent, they would have been charged with a crime. There is no doubt about that once the investigation was completed. But this is all irrelevant since the baby didn't die and was born without complications. This whole thread is founded upon a huge what if in order to demonize pro-lifers while ignoring what the pro-death advocates truly represent as they support infanticide for the sake of the convenience of irresponsible women.
feel_584	feel	But you have heard of ID, right? And you think that ID - pushed by the Discovery Institute - is somehow science?
feel_1502	feel	You have conviced no one or even come remotely to forming an argument.
feel_1258	feel	So it's the scientific community that sets up communication within a society, and then the dumb old common peasants come along and screw it all up? Hahaha - sorry but I'm not convinced.
feel_553	feel	So in other words your God put you on Earth to stop people from killing so your God could kill them eventually?
feel_235	feel	Well, I guess you're entitled to your opinions. On the gun-control board, I imagine you might encounter a lot of rednecks- not the best specimen of our poplulation.
feel_221	feel	So Bush is responsible for the death of Third World mothers now?! Get real! There are billions of people on this planet, chose another vilian for a change. :xcensored
feel_547	feel	Good idea!
feel_209	feel	"You started off with criticizing gun banning, but now you seem to be criticizing tough punishments for criminals. A May 2006 article in the Cape Times said that ""National law currently provides for a sentence of 25 years for illegal firearm possession.""   http://www.capetimes.co.za/index.php...icleId=3230121  So if the death penalty is the punishment for illegal gun possession then I suppose the law must have changed recently. I wonder if the people who claim that we don't need more gun laws but just tougher punishments for people who break current gun laws would support such a penalty."
feel_1072	feel	"I think you and WW should discuss definitions of life. It might be interesting to watch.   In the meantime, would you mind outlining the ""process"" of life?"
feel_792	feel	I know you don't. So what?
feel_786	feel	Yes...if you ignore people, they eventually go away...except for me, of course. :)
feel_1066	feel	Well that explains the twisted thought pattern on our constitution is broken.
feel_976	feel	Homeless, yes, as long as they're legal residents. Illegal aliens, no.      Health care is a civil right, but not a human one. There are no human rights.
feel_962	feel	"Oh, right. And what would yours be? ""We the humble people of the human species have decided to break away from Britan rule and form our own bubble community. No one has any rights whatsoever, and we restrict our citizens to living in bubbles because we cherish each life, from skin cells to bacteria to plants to embryos. In fact, we really have no purpose in life, we just life to not kill other lives."
feel_751	feel	By your own admission you haven't 'hung out' with stoners for a while and you're making generalisations about them to people who do spend a lot of time with stoners?
feel_989	feel	And your point is?       If you're trying to go that since there are allegories in the Bible, then science does not contridict it, then you are clearly a revisionist who is warping and distorting the bible to suit a specific agenda.
feel_745	feel	oh, it's obvious that non-darwinists have no affect on you guys. Nothing will ever change your mind because your mind is not made up on the evidence...it's made up on your worldview and your belief in materialism.
feel_779	feel	As far as I'm aware your aim is for abortion not to happen, my point is that despite making it illegal it will still happen -- making it illegal is not achieving your aim.      Hence my point is sound, and as such it is a good point.
feel_1099	feel	You have done it again. emoticon_rolleyes
feel_1106	feel	Because taking responsibility for ones own safety is certainly a sissy thing to do??? emoticon_confused
feel_180	feel	No. Differential reproductive success.
feel_1660	feel	The issue is about you linking an incident where a pregnant woman had so little regard for her unborn baby that she picked a fight with the police and somehow use it to demonise the police and the pro life people.  I could not imagine anyone could be stupid enough to do this without the aid of strong drink but thank you for reminding me that you can do it easily.
feel_1112	feel	"what the ""eff"" are you talking about?! wrong thread buddy."
feel_11	feel	So you put words in Machs mouth. This would be acceptable if you were not doing it in a malicious fashion to get some sort of sadistic pleasure but you were instead actually trying to get him to explain himself. At any rate it totally disproves your nonsense about how you above me because you do not put words into peoples mouths because you do the same. You were not being dishonest to start with I admit it would be wrong to deliberately misrepesent you but neither of the circumstances apply here.
feel_194	feel	"And where exactly is your proof that ""Stop, don't touch, leave the area, tell an adult"" is indoctrination and translates to ""go out and buy a gun, buy as many guns as possible, obsess over the gun, etc."""

And what if one Siamese twin has legs but the other doesn't? Isn't the other twin dependent on the one with legs? Could a doctor ethically remove the legless twin if the legged twin wanted to and if the legless twin was retarded and the procedure would leave the legless twin dead?  *(or her best.. I'm sorry but my doctor is male, so I will no longer use ""his/her"" or ""he/she""... it just gets tiring after a while...)"
feel_802	feel	If they're voting then they should be paying taxes too. There's no excuse for those lazy stiffs to avoid being miserable along with everybody else. Nobody ever said that taxes had to stop just because you do.

feel_816	feel	I'm not big on the abortion issue, but are you saying that anyone who disagrees with you is sexist and arrogant?  That's a tactic straight from the leftist playbook. Clearly you're the one who's arrogant, if you can make these kinds of baseless generalizations of your opponents. Isn't it you who always accuses conservatives of being intolerant of people who think differently than them? Now that's irony! emoticonXGood

feel_427	feel	No problem. I personally believe killing innocent children is wrong. Yet, I also believe that a woman's decision to murder her child is between her and her god.

That cannot be coincidence. God has lifted his protecting hand because of my letter.  But seriously, 3 people I ran into today told me they saw it. Two were people at work: one just said she read it without saying how she felt about it, the other went a bit farther to say that it really didn't offend her. But if you think about it, just her comment indicates that she felt that the way most people would respond would be negatively. The other person was my dentist, who I just happened to have an appointment with today. He starting talking at great length about Hugh Ross, and Gerald Shroeder, and how his own personal faith in Jesus and science get along just fine. I listened for about 15 minutes, only saying a few things now and then. And when I did, I didn't argue against his position ... I just pointed out that people really have to accept that evolution is true and that the Earth is billions of years old, which he had already said he accepted.
feel_432	feel	Really? I haven't seen you post your support for any law or proposal that would punish criminals in the most severe ways possible. All I've ever seen you post support for is more laws that criminalize things that aren't crimes and do nothing to harm others.

We will never be able to define exactly what or who God is!  God is great.  God is good.  Let us thank Him for our food.  God is my shepherd.  God is my Light.  God is my Co-pilot.

Just because this difference cannot be analyzed, measured or defined does not mean it's not there. You can't analyze or define your thought patterns, dreams, brainwaves or consciousness either -- but that does not mean they aren't there.

It's a self-contradictory statement. One you're fond of, I realize, but illogical just the same.  You can test this by trying to show me something that is unknowable.   See the dillema you face? Yes, self-contradiction. You may be so use to this feeling that you've grown numb to it, but in black and white, you are making a self-contradictory statement.  This is the same reason you have to have faith. Rational demonstration is useless when trying to show something without evidence or without rational demonstration, which is the case with your ""unknowable, self-contradictory"" idea of a god.  This is why you MUST believe through faith, which requires no rational demontration. It's no secret why faith needs no evidence, it CANNOT use evidence, it's the opposite of reason. Why do you think the term faith exists in the first place? Reason does fine with the rational world. You needed a word to fit the irrational. Otherwise, why would you need faith?  It's the same reason you can have 1000 different gods and beliefs of gods out there and not a single one is somehow ""more credible"" than any other. They are all based without reason, without evidence, irrationally.  All ties together rather neatly doesn't it?  Science >> Religion  Reason >> Faith  Rational >> Irrational  Evidence >> No evidence  Reason: Capable of seperating truth from false (to degree, based on evidence), and thus produces knowledge (That which we find to be true).

feel_591	feel	But why is that criteria of birth important, in your view, for calling it a person? Is the existence of a person dependent on their physical location, in your view (in this case, inside the woman's body vs outside)? Otherwise, are there other characteristics that change in the fetus from the moments it is inside the body to the moment it is outside of the body? How about when it is born but not yet disconnected from its mother by cutting the umbilical cord?  I understand that you might be stating this for legal reasons - i.e. defining person as born since the term person might automatically have rights attached and you don't want any rights for fetuses - no matter what their state of development. If so, then I would say that you are putting the cart before the horse. In viewing moral issues, I think one should try to understand the fundamentals and then work legal opinions around those fundamentals - not the other way around.

The prevention models for these are different in case you were unaware.   You fail to even consider how many of those lives were taken by criminals in the commission of a crime. Yet you would render us helpless to them in your quest for a non hostile working environment. Show exactly where in the constitution and Bill of Rights the wording for gun control. Here is a clue, they aren't there.   If you were truely concerned about loss of innocent life then you would be supporting laws to keep the violent criminal away from society. Instead they are free after many arrests and convictions to prey upon a society that you would render helpless. Why Brady?

feel_1065	feel	As an adoptive parent of 3 with decent knowledge of how 'the system' works, it's these annoying BS answers that tick me off. Perpetuating ignorance if not outright deciet to justify a decision to abort.  As for caring for the kid once they're here, that can be costly. More so for time. If you're poor, EIC and earned child tax credits and deductions help alleviate the child's cost (the gov't wants another generation of consumers and tax payers). You can get your liability to near 0 and have the gov't kick back some money.   But, we're talking adoption.  On top of these decisions, you also have consider the health risks fo carring the child to term OR the risks involved in getting an abortion.   It's nice to think that you'll 'plan' a child later but, life seldom works that way. I'd hate to think that once you're finally ready to have a child, your uterus has been scarred to infertility or have sever complications in conception, carrying the child to term or delivery. I'd be ironic for another yuppy type who can't have children on their own due to an abortion to have to incure greater medical costs to have one or legal costs to adopt...and maybe even seeking a foreign child as there aren't any easily to be had here...since they were all aborted. Also, the older you get, the more health issues possible for the child.  As for the intellectuals who wait to have birth later in life, watch Idiocracy starring Luke Wilson. Then smile as it IS the XXXXXX who are inheriting the world. But, what would you care? You won't be here...and most likely, neither will your decendents.  If you want to kill it, then just kill it and say 'What's it too you?' or even 'Yeah, so I'm selfish and didn't want to take time out of my life to be bothered with details, bugger off ya wanker!'

feel_949	feel	I have to agree with you. The Mother is usually the one responsible for conceiving the baby. The man should be responsible too, but she's the one who will get pregnant and she has to consent to sex. I don't think a woman should have the right to do what she likes with her body and kill her baby whenever she gets pregnant. I think the responsibility rests with the Mother first in this case, and the baby should not die for her.

So perhaps I should ask, if God were not threatening religious people with Hell, would they still be good people? Or are all of the selfless and generous actions of religious people stemmed from the selfish desire to get into heaven? If they are not stemmed from their own selfish desire to enter heaven, then they are they not rooted in that individual's own desire to help others. This exists in some people.  For those in whom it does not exist, we have the law. We create governments to do that which is in our best interest and that which is in our best interest is that which helps everyone. For that which harms someone else might soon be that which harms us.  I have oversimplified what is a very complex understanding of morality, but the point is that the morality of an atheist does not begin with the desire to enter heaven, it begins with the desire to help others or create a society which will help everyone.

Those who preach hate, and those who act on that hate, like Hitler, the KKK, and any other person/persons filled with hate (sad to say, this seems to apply to our own friend Archie here) are the ones who will end up in hell.

feel_586	feel	I'm an atheist pretty much the same reason you are an atheist (except for going to a religious school.  I didn't really think it was fair and balanced at all. It protrayed atheists as lost from the true path. The reasons it gave for being atheist were they hadn't found god yet, and a tradgedy. What about logically thinking about it? And a RELIGIOUS STUDIES teacher says that atheism is just a phase? They also say atheism is the easy way out. I think it's easier to just believe in a god and be comforted. I'm not saying people do but I'd say Christianity is more of a quick fix than atheism. All you have to do is believe in god and you're safe for your life and afterwards. Most Atheists don't believe what they do just to rebel or haven't found God yet. Mostly it's because they realized that there is no logical proof (enough for them) that there is God. They also said incorrectly that atheism isn't a religion.  reÂ·liÂ·gion [ri lÃ­jj?n]  n   1. religion beliefs and worship: people?s beliefs and opinions concerning the existence, nature, and worship of a deity or deities, and divine involvement in the universe and human life   MicrosoftÂ® EncartaÂ® Reference Library 2003.

I have already listed on a number of posts why it's not constitutional.  Since you missed it (It's only the first post in the thread)  For gay coupes right to be married (Or the same legal status)  1. Human rights with regards to legal classifcation and the benefits therein are desired by comitted consenting adults of the same gender.  2. It's a contract between two consenting adults.  3. A contract that does not violate anyone's legal rights or cause any significant ill effects to the public welfare.  It's unconstitutional to allow one group of people access to marriage rights (hetero couples only), and not allow it to female/female and male/male couples when they are obviously lobbying for it in significant numbers. It's now a public issue on a significant scale.  Of course, maybe if you had a REASON for objecting to gays being treated equally with regards to the rights of marriage, we would understand not only why you are reluctant to back your claim, but why your reason is also not constitutional.  You can call it games, I call it justifying my position while pointing out how opponents of gay rights, such as yourself, really can't make any reasonable justification for their desire to restrict human rights, other than saying ""well I want to""...or in your case... ""shhh...it's a secret"".  You know what WE call it on the debate forum when one side refuses to present or rebut arguments? Losing the debate. I realize winning and losing..i.e. being right and being wrong are not concepts found in religion, where anything goes...but out here in the real world actions have consequences, and words...yes, imagine that, have specific meanings. You verbally support a movement that restricts human rights, yet won't give us reasons for your position. I find that appalling. Yet you are content with labeling me as ""playing games"".

It was the RULE for RICH CHRISTIAN WOMEN IN EUROPE NOT TO BREASTFEED THEIR BABIES BECAUSE IT WOULD THEM SEXUALLY UNATTRACTIVE TO THEIR RICH CHRISTIAN HUSBANDS!!! A poor woman was usually hired to serve as a wetnurse for said child--and I certainly hope that the children of that poor woman did not suffer as a result of the poor woman's economic need to serve as a wetnurse for a RICH CHRISTIAN WOMAN'S CHILD, but you can be very sure that THE RICH CHRISTIAN WOMAN AND HER RICH, DEMANDING CHRISTIAN HUSBAND DID NOT GIVE A FLYING FARK ABOUT THE WELFARE OF THE poor woman's children!

feel_1277	feel	When contraception failed in my monogamous long term relationship, I heavily researched both options, as well as parenting. I looked into requirements for Medicaid, WIC, and other subsidized assistance offered in my community. I called a few clinics around town. That's an interesting story, but not for here.  I had heart to heart talks to many different people with different viewpoints.  I decided to have an abortion because I was sick all the time. I had diagnosed migraine headaches constantly, and my seizure disorder that had laid dormant for years returned. I couldn't leave my house. I lost my job. I was in the middle of my education (it was early summer) and if I continued my pregnancy it would have put me back a semester, thus costing thousands of dollars. The father did not want me to continue the pregnancy because he was concerned about my physical health.  Just thinking about that time period makes me nauseated.  I understood the merits of adoption, especially since my father was adopted. I talked to my aunt about adoption and foster care, since she has participated in both. I also thought about parenting, the love and all the things I have to offer. I knew that the father would have supported my decision to parent, I knew that our financial hardships could be dealt with, and I knew that my education could be continued later.  I came to the conclusion that abortion was the best choice for me and my health. I appreciate that some may find this decision selfish, and essentially it is, since it was made with my best interests in mind. I would also hope that even if they consider it selfish, they understand the reasons why I made that decision. And if it was your wife, daughter, friend, and she was dealing with what I was, you would not expect her to continue a pregnancy.

So continue to lie to yourself if it gets you through the day, iangb. Convince yourself that you can pick and choose what is absolute truth in this life too, and see how far that gets you.

I'm sure you won't even considered that your wrong about either of these things though I doubt you have any reason to believe in either of them other than you have the idea stuck in your head now.

The reason you may think I may be presenting information contrary to normative Christian teaching is that you have picked a peculiarly thorny passage - something that skeptics of the Bible and enemies of God will almost always do.[\QUOTE]  It only answers the contradiction after you fill in the blanks with your own interpretation and of course your interpretation is based on your personal views and no facts. All the facts that you can work with are in the Bible and as of this moment the Bible seems to have a flaw in it. Your trying to cover this flaw with a story that you made up.

This has basically just become a religious debate instead of one on abortion and I think if you want to find the answer to this question you will need to debate on the Religion board.  Also if everything that occurs is Gods will, then isn't it Gods will that an abortion take place if it does occur?  I won't debate that an aborted baby could have been responsible for an important event in the future if it had been born, but this is a rare event. I submit to you this idea as well if you like the cases of rare events. What if one of those babies grew up and killed someone who would be responsible for an important future event had he lived long enough to do so? That is a rare case as well. I'm sure you will say this doesn't justify abortion and I'll agree with you because both our points about low probability instances are so rare that they shouldn't matter in this debate anyways.

Should a wealthy woman with tons of money be able to have as many kids as her pocket will allow? maybe  But on the other hand, should a poor woman without two red cents to rub together be required to abort her very loved and wanted child? probably not.

feel_1442	feel	This is a pretty touchy issue, and I agree with the different points of view.. most of them make sense... while I don't personally agree with abortion, I don't feel that I have the right to tell someone else what they should do. The way I see it, is that it's their body, their life, they are the ones who will be affected by their decision. I don't have to like the choices someone else makes, and I don't have to agree with it, but while I have that right, I also believe that people should have the right to make those decisions. Are these anti-abortion people going to step in and pay for the cost of having the baby, raising it, etc..??? Maybe some of those are the issues people consider when having an abortion. Maybe the woman was raped. I see the point when someone said that the baby should not be punished for that, and I agree with that, but the rape was committed against the woman's will... she didn't ask for that to happen, and if a pregnancy results from that, that is also against her will, so why should she feel that she has to have the child? What does she tell the child when it decides to ask who its father is?? The child could still be born and given up for adoption, and that is a good idea, but maybe the woman will relive the rape throughout the pregnancy by being reminded of it on a daily basis.... all I feel is until it happens to you, and YOU are forced to make these kinds of choices, you shouldn't judge anyone else for the choices that they make.

feel_177	feel	SP: Hello again. I hope you are well. God is difficult to define. One would not expect a finite being such as myself to define clearly and completely an infinite being such as God.   However, as with any person God has defined himself. We all definie or identify, ourselves by various methods. What we like and dislike. What we do, where we go, where we have been. God has done this as well in the bible. He has mades statements about the things he likes and dislikes (The ten commandments for instance). He tells what he does (he is a creator for instance, He loves, he has mercy and grace.) He tells us where he has been (He is the God that is, was, and will be, in otherwords exists outside of time).  There are other things naturally. I can tell you some because as a finite being I will take a life time getting to know him. This is true with any person. You cannot completely define your closest and dearest friend. It is impossible because people are infinitely complex. You can know your friend none the less. This is true of God as well. You have heard me talk about God on this forum for quite sometime. This is how God is defined. You ask an impossibly broad question. Sglaine seems to imply that theists will only hamper you with illogic when it comes to defining God and they will eventually say they don't know. I know some not all. So do you. This is right. To assume that we should be able to define God completely and accurately is illogical.

I wish I could determine that an item is bad using one train of logic, and then SWITCH LINES OF LOGIC to suit my argument!  I will bet that simone will choose to COMPLETELY IGNORE MY POST because I am removing all lines of dishonest ""logic switching"". (or, at least attempting to)  Rather than admit wrongness, (very hard to do once a person has so vehemently commited themselves to an agenda) there is no other choice than to follow the trail of that path to the end. Even if the path leads to a land of complete logical make believe and you are thereby forced to defend your chosen agenda even if it means temporarily making logical ""detours"".   After all, if objects have no inherent evil or goodness, it must be the character of the USER and the chosen purpose of the USER that determines the ethical value of how an item is used.  If this is so, you can't call guns bad. This determination can not be admitted on the path simone has chosen. Therefore, since simone's agenda insists on the inherent evilness of an object (a gun) there MUST be some logical deviation to explain why these ""evil"" items are not ""evil"" when used by police. If there is no logical deviation on a path that is in error, you will have no choice but to arrive in error's destination: make believe land! Where matches burn down houses! And knives cause slashings! And candle holders cause bashed in skulls!....AND......AND.....GUNS CAUSE SHOOTINGS!  Well, simone. We're down to brass tacks. Is a gun bad, or is it the determination of the person who uses it?  Because if a gun is bad, then we live in la-la land. And if a gun is an inanimate object who's user is responsible for how it is used, you have no argument for why law abiding people can't posess them and be capable of the determination (As police do) for using them in a responsible manner. Just like matches, or cars, or candle holders.  So, simone............"

So who are you people to even judge the intelligence of those who will ultimately be proven to have known the truth regarding our origins, to the lies that you so proudly defend?   I say this only so you pseudo intellectuals will have some personal introspection to consider rather than just assuming that you'll get the correct answers by leaning on human understanding. It is incredible that you can't even see that you are bankrupt when you rely on unprovable assumptions that are based on preconceived notions, that have been both failing and conflicting with all of the new discoveries made in each generation to follow, thereby forcing the need to redefine the parameters by which evolution works every 10 years or so.

feel_1287	feel	"Translation: Anti-abortionist intellectuals aren't really opposed to abortion as an end in itself, they only oppose abortion because they believe forcing women to remain pregnant is an appropriate punishment for their True Sin, sex outside of marriage.  The goal isn't to ""prevent murder"" at all, this is merely a convenient excuse to punish women who stray from traditional relationships.  That's why those opposed to abortion are also opposed to contraception, even though contraception prevents abortion.  So the fact that abortion protestors also prevent people from accessing contraception isn't contradictory at all, it is completely in line with their goals."

But I am not about to take the side of a rapist... I don't care how abused they were. When I said that the woman would be reliving the rape, I didn't mean that they wouldn't otherwise... but think if you were a woman and were raped, and became pregnant by someone you didn't know or know anything about...   As for the murder part of it, what is it called when anti-abortionists picket outside clinics and shoot and kill the abortion doctors? Is that not murder? Doesn't that make them hypocrites?

I place value on the life of the feotus because it is close to human, it has the potential to become human. The closer any being is to being human the more value I tend to place on its life. I value monkeys more than I value cows, for example, I value cows more than I value mice, or rats. I would only kill cows for food, not for sport or because they were irritating. Mice I would kill or have killed if there was an infestation and I couldn't get rid of them any other way, insects I'm not too bothered about swatting if they annoy me. The feotus I consider to be close to human, closer than any other species and, whilst I consider it wrong to kill it, I can understand why others don't and recognise that banning abortion also results in suffering and loss of life. It's a difficult decision for me whether the loss of feotuses is balanced by the suffering prevented, lives saved and freedom promoted by keeping it legal.

feel_1332	feel	Well if it saves my life what is the problem??      Aren't we pro life here?????
feel_1326	feel	I'm confused by your rationale in your post as it is basically all over the place- perhaps you could clarify your position better.  I disagree we are debating philosophy here but discussing far less abstract real world issues and how they relate to the matter of abortion.
feel_1440	feel	Isn't it interesting that TQ is so hard up for a reason to attack me that he must himself use a fallacious position to do it from. Thanks TQ, for being so consistent in your dishonesty. :) emoticon_xagree
feel_1468	feel	"So sorry, I was trying to figure out why God lets some women down, and yet favored you. I always assumed it was a mixture of physiology, luck, etc. Sometimes bad things happen, sometimes good things happen. But you claimed God was the one who saw you through and made sure your daughter was born healthy and functional...So, again, in a similar situation (trust in God, doctors say baby will be born damaged, etc), if it turns out the doctors were right, is God to blame for letting me down? Or was it, in fact, just the way things are sometimes?  Or does God just randomly hear some prayers, but not others? No, no...lemme guess. ""God has a plan for us all""?"
feel_388	feel	Oh I've got no doubt that you do, and that you wish much worse on him than that as well.
feel_411	feel	But can you answer simone or jito's argument's successfully and counter their posts? If you can't, then in essance, they won.
feel_1497	feel	Oh, really?       Translation: the only amendments that rise and fall are the ones that I want to.
feel_377	feel	On what that drugs and alchohol are not moral equivelants to being gay?
feel_363	feel	Why should I call myself that since everyone on the planet is as well?
feel_405	feel	But in both situations, there are things that an individual can do to reduce the risks of bad things happening. There are also things that cannot be done in either situation to completely eliminate risk. I already mentioned that there is a genetic component to heart disease. My entire point has essentially been that human beings don't always deal with risk in entirely realistic ways.
feel_1483	feel	Why? You'll just call them 'stupid'. And by doing so you will have effectively trumped all of the facts in one fell swoop. Right?
feel_439	feel	Don't expect your misrepresentations of the findings of those studies to sink in. I'm not that easily fooled.
feel_438	feel	"No, in other words ""the cut and thrust of peer review."" Where ID falls flat on its face. Stop trying to dress that up as some kind of underserved mugging; if you aren't prepared to understand and defend ID on a scientific level you aren't equipped to decide that it is being unfairly treated."
feel_362	feel	The thing is, our technology will be radically different in the future, provided that the conservatives don't go nuts on us and slow the advance of technlogy.
feel_1482	feel	"Seer, dude,.. chill.  I'm on your side.  I mis-spoke.   I don't follow your ""womb trapped child"" line of reason. It's not a comment about anything other than the fact that I haven't put much thought into it.  Relax a bit and take a deep breath.  Try to realize that not all who are sceptical about your posts are your enemies."
feel_404	feel	you know why? because God touches our hearts like nothing you have ever felt before. it is amazing

feel_410	feel	Oh yeah, sure, your rights have been violated by companies requiring you to work 40 hours a week! Would somebody be so good as to call the ACLU for Brady so he can get a lawsuit going which claims that having to work is a violation of his fundamental human rights and is unconstitutional?
feel_376	feel	Go pound sand. You're the people who want the Separation of Church and State, remember? Get your sick, satanic mits off the church.
feel_1469	feel	And how many murderers have got away with it because they lured their victim to their home? And how many people have got away with killing someone just for trespassing. I'm glad I live in a civilised country where the aim is to avoid people getting killed.
feel_389	feel	Just think, without Christianity and its preservation of science during the Dark Ages, we lost out on the opportunity to reinvent the wheel. emoticon_rolleyes    That has got to go down as one of the dumbest things that I've ever read on this forum.
feel_1327	feel	I think this post pretty much sums up the depths of your prejudice, and the thoroughness of your ignorance.  A child should endure physical abuse before being allowed to be adopted by a loving gay couple?  Being abused physically is preferential to being adopted by a loving gay couple?  emoticonXWow   I always have to chuckle when people are so eager to reveal their prejudices in such a way that demonstrates they are completely non-credible as any type of character witness...
feel_1441	feel	So where will you be moving to?
feel_1455	feel	So if it's not human, we can kill it? But I dare say that's a different topic completely. Sorry, that was more along animal rights than abortion. Abortion is this for me: If the baby is going to endanger the mother's life as well as the baby, why endanger the baby and the mother? Sticking on the decided path, would you rather kill something you know is human, or something that you're not sure is human. It sounds a bit cruel and I didn't intend it to be that way at all. It's just that one loss would hard enough, why make it two?
feel_1333	feel	Now you've ruined it! You're not supposed to mention god. That's the whole idea. ID is stealth creationism. XXXXXX pretend that there is some scientific basis for the assertion that there is some sort of magical designer that is responsible for everything, but they don't say it's god. If they did that, then ID would be religion and introducing it into schools would be unconstitutional.
feel_148	feel	Why is that? Because you disagree with them?
feel_606	feel	And that's what I'm talking about. It doesn't have to have been 'explained' to me. I already know that's your view.
feel_160	feel	And teen sex doesn't, by the very nature of it's action, result in ending a life that would grow into a toddler, a child, an adolescent, and an adult--basically the action of killing someone.
feel_174	feel	"Forest for the freakin' trees.  So when heterosexual couples divorce, it's all automatic and assumed. Gay and straight people alike help foot the bill.  Straight couples ""have abso-freaking-lutely no qualms about forcing Mr. and Mrs. John Q. Taxpayer to pony up more dough""...  But when it comes to homosexual couples divorcing, it's only the gay individuals who ""shell out more $$$"".  Can you explain why it's just for gays to help pay for the divorce of straight couples, but the same is not done for gays??? emoticonXEmbarrassed"
feel_612	feel	Which demonstrates your failure to see the big picture.
feel_821	feel	I think Kronus pretty much covered that one...quite well actually.   It's sad SS, you always harp against NS, but you obviously have no clue what NS is really all about. I suggest a little educational reading. I at least read the bible before I began to publically debate it's validity.
feel_1119	feel	So if I did find a vender, then what would you say? Why do we prevent the importation of weapons grade plutonium? Shouldn't that be protected under the second amendment? Why doesn't the government allow people to produce nucleur weapons? If the government suddenly stopped all production of guns except those that were sold to the Department of defense, would it suddenly make this arguement moot?
feel_835	feel	This past Saturday, my partner and I had a commitment ceremony or wedding if you say care to say.....In my state it is not legally bindingm we did it anyway.....it was more about the emotional commitment two people make to each other in the presence of their friends and family. I tried so hard not to, but when the celebrant asked me to repeat after him, with the vows I wrote my self.....I tried and tried and tried, but couldn't speak. I was too moved by the moment and all I could do was cry....  I love my partner with all my heart....So I wanted to get through, I thought about our taxes (didn't work). So thought about everyone in their underware.....contrary to popular opinoin that doesn't work either.....  I managed to get the words out (don't know how) just did!  This marriage is just as perfect to us, and those that were our witnessess.....as any heterosexual wedding......  The rest of the night was blur, between 50 people wanting my attention and me being really buzzed on white wine.....oh my oh my.......I was pretty shocked!  Marrige is what you decide it is, regardles if the gov was to see it....I am now married.....like it or not.
feel_1643	feel	"i'm impressed! this is a very precise description, in regular english  and yes, the deduction in 9 seems presumptious if all we state is God has a ""possibility of existence"". how this was cleverly cleared up (from the same source site) was simply a trip back to the definition: ""greatest possible being"". the ""greatest possible being"", by definition, MUST have a possible existence. in otherwords, we cannot assume that there is a possibility that the greatest possible being does not exist. yeah, it sounds like the whole ""proof"" is pointless because your premise is already the proof  just keep in mind that for the purposes of this proof, God is defined as ""the greatest being possible"". as long as that definition is maintained, the proof works...  does that mean that God exists? hmmm....emoticonXFrazzled"
feel_26	feel	Yes, according to JimmyJ.      God, the laws regarding murder from all over the world, have absolutely no impact upon the holy proclamations emanating from JimmyJ.

feel_32	feel	You know Brady, you've said a lot of stupid stuff over the years. I even remember finding a post of yours where you said all guns and gun owners should be registered, but sex offenders shouldn't be.   This latest post of yours is just another senseless and stupid rambling of somebody that's so hateful and fearful of an inanimate object that it's impossible for him to function in our society and can barely handle his own needs.
feel_1131	feel	"This is wrong. You yourself find ""mental existence"" to be ""sacred' in a way. There is no rational argument for mental existence being the point of obtaining rights...no matter how hard any of us try :p"
feel_809	feel	But they can't be true christians if they accept evolution.
feel_1657	feel	I know that. I asked those questions to show how dumb and ridiculous unkerpaulies question was - took it to other examples where such a question is obviously ridiculous to illustrate the ridiculousness of his question.
feel_996	feel	I know! How dare they just not sit back and accept the discrimination they so rightly deserve. It's just incredible the amount physical and emotional damage you would undergo if these people are given the same kind of respect you are. We can't have that! This may be a a government for the people, and I am sorry but you are only part of the people and to be granted the respect of people if you screw and love the people that the majority say you have to screw and love. God bless er Buddha bless er Mohammed bless...er Rhiannon bless America! emoticonXRolleyes
feel_982	feel	Well bravo for you - they must not be all that good considering. Or did you simply learn to be deceptive yourself and confuse that with deception by others? Who can say?
feel_772	feel	Really? You've sought to intervene so far. Why stop?
feel_1092	feel	All of that sounds a lot like Deism.       Personally, if I was somehow FORCED to believe in a religion, based on what I currently know of the lot, it would be Deism.

feel_955	feel	It's completely illogical.
feel_1079	feel	Tell me it ain't so!!! Unfrickin believable!
feel_799	feel	Really?  She was taken to two different hospitals and an ICU, and she still died? Health care has nothing to do with it. This seems like a desperate cry to change, but not unfair government work. SHE WAS GOING TO DIE REGARDLESS! This had nothing to do with being treated unfairly, but it had everything to do with a sob case that was misstated, and uncharged. It doesn't make sense, and unless it's changed, I don't think that it ever will.
feel_941	feel	So you know what Ozzy was trying to say in his pointless statement? How do you know your interpretation is correct while mine is wrong? How exactly do you justify taking the word of a man who bit the head off of a bat, as something credible?
feel_969	feel	Which lie is that?
feel_1051	feel	NO ONE HAS TO HAVE A GUN! The point is is that the choice should be up to the individual. If a criminal thinks you are armed he will move on (or he has a death wish)
feel_1045	feel	This coming from the person that makes insane claims without providing evidence. Atleast provide some when asked!
feel_558	feel	"yes, and i suppose an idea of perfection can exist, in a thinker's mind, and subjective to the thinker's standards of perfection. i could also point out that an imperfect thinker, with no reference or standard of ""objective"" perfection, is incapable of having a perfect idea of anything. therefore the argument falls apart at the first premise, since an ""idea of perfection"" cannot exist, unless the thinker himself is perfect, which would make him God by his own definition."
feel_1290	feel	Because evolution is the main weapon that is used against traditional U.S. morals and customs.
feel_216	feel	But we certainly have the right to evict such persons.      But then, regardless, the embryo is not a person.
feel_570	feel	Well, that is obsurd and you know it yourself.. If you are going to make arguments, at least make ones that matter.
feel_564	feel	Actually, I am of the opinion that the fetus has no natural rights of its own. Any rights we grant to a person as a citizen or national are granted at the moment of birth. By granting equal rights to a 3week old fetus that you do to a 20 year old man, you are endangering the rights of the woman who carries that child. Yes, I believe that in most circumstances, the child should be carried to term, but there are exceptions to every rule, and I'm not quite ready to forsake the lives and health of women to protect unborn children. Yes, I think the unborn child is worthy of protection, but not any more so than the mother, in fact probably less.
feel_4	feel	We are saying the same thing.
feel_1284	feel	Could you be so kind as to point out the holes, please? Or are you going to dance around some more?

feel_1535	feel	People like this guy, and Henry Hyde, Newt Gingrich, Robert Livingston, and so many others happen to be right wing republicans....isn't that peculiar?
feel_1521	feel	So you are not an American? You believe that your religion should be forced on everyone by the government? Is it OK if I am allowed to teach your children my religion?
feel_1247	feel	haha, so because of this you should make fun of men and not women? That makes no sense but I figured you'd say this.
feel_1519	feel	I would just want the woman to ask that question before she spreads her legs.   Dono
feel_1243	feel	So...all Christians have some sort of brain damage, trebor? You're not getting any better at this are you?
feel_1525	feel	"No, it is not a bad deal for the child. However, my beliefs do not permit murder, even if it is a better ""deal""."
feel_1531	feel	The Christian community DOES have a split on the issue.   Not all Christians believe gays should be the target of Christian homophobic attacks and discriminatory legislative efforts.
feel_1257	feel	Which planet in your parallel universe did this happen on? You should stick to topics on which you know something............... Oh, sorry, I see your problem.
feel_548	feel	Thank you for repeating me.
feel_206	feel	Its very sad to me that we have to brake the bondage of religion. I thought we did that? I was wrong. We under siege, from something horrible. One thing this horror is not, itâs not from God.  Jesus could not follow fundamentalism, he couldnât do it. Yet the monsters head rises again and so we must address the lies and twists this creature wants to chain us with. If we as nation are forced to obey this Dragon called fundamentalism; our children will be drinking blood and casting out demons from foreign lands all their lives.  Nothing is more terrible or sinful than a Dogmatic man thinking he is doing the will of a God. Families have sacrificed (and are) their Children and drank the cool aid of the false Prophets.   We have no choice anymore. We can not allow 2000 year old texts to be a literal book of guidance for a country our fathers fought to keep free. Donât give up your fight, use logic and literary knowledge to tear down their straw houses. Use their book. Read it once and see what it says. The concepts in it actually destroy it. Itâs failures in logic are easily shown as even laughable. Only then can man kind God. Secularism allows for such liberty. Church and Church states never will.
feel_1280	feel	Then why doesn't He answer prayers like He says He will in the Bible?
feel_0	feel	Well if you are Catholic you would should probably find him pretty credible.
feel_560	feel	There are a lot of these people don't understand or don't make sense to them. I guess the things that don't are just stupid and made-up, huh?
feel_574	feel	Is there a difference?
feel_212	feel	Now that's just scary, I must say.
feel_1294	feel	You know, considering how little ray knows about science, do you think we could write a creationist load of **** and take these XXXXXX for all their money?
feel_945	feel	So lets say that if, and I know this has nothing to do with the topic of gay marriage, but do the people have a right to amend the constitution to introduce slavery? Does the majority have a right to deny a minority freedom? I already know you answer. You believe in the tyranny of the majority.  Why do you want the people to vote to take other people marriages away? I do not understand your reasoning on this. Besides you have never answered my question.  Do you have any compassion?
feel_1069	feel	Actually your arguement should follow have you ever seen an aborted 2 week old embryo ;)
feel_951	feel	"This is a poor poor analogy. Abortion is dealing with the decision to end another's life in order to sustain a preferred lifestyle.   I think you may have been better off putting it this way.   Say you dont drive drunk (personally against it for whatever reason). However, you believe others should have the right to drive drunk if they so choose. So, you are personally against drunk driving but you are ""pro-choice"" in that regard (meaning you believe every person should make that determination for themselves). Therefore there should be no laws preventing it and no punishment for the sad results.   Pro-life would be: You don't drive drunk (morally against it perhaps) and you are going to make sure no one else is able to either."
feel_789	feel	And yet you could care less if a Gay teen blows his brains out.....
feel_979	feel	Everyone expects that. What they don't and shouldn't have to expect is that they will be specifically targeted and have to pay more, be penalised more, etc. than hetero couples such as yourself or me and my husband.
feel_1041	feel	Ok, so you are admitting that the unborn fetus, is in fact, a child? I have to believe that is what you mean from your statement above. That being the case, do you condone the killing of a child that is born but will likely live in poverty the rest of his or her life? Do you condone the killing of a handicapped child that is born? If not, then you can't condone abortion. Also, who gives you the right to decide what is best for a child by killing him or her? That should not be your choice (this is another problem with humanism, because there is no moral authority to stop people from doing whatever they want to do, hence the adage that humanism is a philosophy that has both feet planted firmly in mid-air). I am sure the child wouldn't agree to that choice if given a voice to do so.   Let's go ahead and do it your way by taking religion out of law. Is murder still illegal in your humanistic world? Likely it is still illegal because even humanists realize that anarchy is not suitable for society. Then why is this not murder? Look back to effects this has on women. That is also bad for society. And that affects us all.
feel_1055	feel	Really?
feel_986	feel	The right to have a choice IS a legal issue. We don't live in russia emoticon_rolleyes Women in this country have the same rights as men.
feel_992	feel	"What I am trying to point out is that it seemed like you jumped from the term ""punish"" to accusing me of not believing that God would take an aborted child to Heaven. It didn't seem like a logical jump. I know what you meant, but I didn't see the connection."
feel_762	feel	Oh no, it's not too complex for us to understand. So please explain to we simpletons how Intelligent Design is nothing more than animism. But first, here is the truth regarding this newest perverse propaganda you are promoting.
feel_1082	feel	Read THIS slower:
feel_1096	feel	Why is it that evolution cant be considered as a mythical tale?. A tale of how soup turned into a human being , and that has no evidence for all the major links for this story to work!....
feel_776	feel	And thus the human condition is explained at last!
feel_831	feel	So could heterosexual marriage.
feel_1109	feel	Actually, I snipped your remarks because 1) you twisted what I said and 2) I'm already spending too much time arguing with random complainers and I was in a hurry to do something more important at the time.
feel_825	feel	And your Orwellian position is showing.
feel_1653	feel	Because marc has a tendency to be highly dishonest, not to mention a tendency to equate nonreligion/secularism with atheism, I think you should consider clarifying from the get-go that non-theism is not atheism.
feel_36	feel	So cross jurisdictional escort is a fairly common occurrence in the area. You will note that it is not the local cops talking about not being informed....it is the author of the article whining about it.
feel_1135	feel	Jesus was a retarded ancient hippie who walked passed people who were starving and dying, yet didn't help them. Jesus is a man who ignored his family and considered his disciples family instead. Jesus is a man who didn't come to preach peace, but use a sword.  Jesus is a man who didn't repudiate much of the Old Testament atrocities. Jesus is bad, and Jesus is GOd, therefore God is bad. I don't care what the biblical stoner said.
feel_22	feel	Right on.
feel_1121	feel	Still clueless and still presenting a barrel of laffs I see. Have someone that can read and comprehend spell it out for you. I bet yer mun is considering that to get you out of the basement. How's the weight loss coming by the way?
feel_1647	feel	"**  I ""pretend"" to nothing. I am not ""pretending"" to beilieve you to be a materialit/darwinist. I do believe exactly that.  And as for your threat to make my arguments look silly, I'm not shaking in my boots. I've made your arguments look presumptuous, pretentious and silly, but you have never yet succeeded in doing that to any of mine."
feel_819	feel	Because conservatives take pleasure in people suffering.
feel_158	feel	So what do you think about the fact that this baby is much younger and smaller and far less developed than many of those who are aborted?  While this baby 21 week baby is living in one hospital room, down the hall a 22/23/24/25/26 ect week baby is being aborted because it was in the wrong place at the wrong time.
feel_616	feel	No Matthew, we all read it. The fact that you have specific targets in mind for your attacks changes nothing; what everyone says still applies. Please, please, give up this appproach. You're only hurting those you claim to want to help.
feel_170	feel	When you have no constructive comment just attacks the messenger with your insultsand name calling.....typical...............so very sad..........Its radicals like you that hurt the cause of gay rights.........
feel_164	feel	But isn't the price of giving up your rights worth eventually becoming a socialist state where every aspect of your life is controlled by the government? :)
feel_602	feel	"1. I consider my arguments to be ""anti-elective abortion"" not ""pro-life."" And I would appreciate it if you would try to understand the differences between the two. ""Pro-lifers"" approach the abortion debate from an ""all life is sacred"" generally religious based point of view. I do not. I neither believe that ""all life is sacred"" nor that ""god"" or religion should be used in the debate at all.  2. My argument that a ""human individual's life biologically begins at conception"" is not an ""assumption."" It's is a conclusion reached by an indepth study of the facts and references available."
feel_1479	feel	Really?         Oh, derrrr!         Obviously, some people no longer use a sense of humour; a relic.
feel_399	feel	Well...      You can apparently read, but what you have apparently chosen to read - and accept - says much.
feel_1337	feel	"I know I am raising my away as far away from the ""right"" way as possible.      Get it?      wuka wuka wuka"
feel_1451	feel	And here is another old standby-Theistic evolutionists do not exist. They are either confused Christians who are losing their faith, or they are lying atheists. So, E. Mutz, Jo Bennett, which are you? Lost christians or lying atheists?
feel_1445	feel	Well both could be a good mother because i know a mother who was very certain she didn't want her baby and went for an abortion but was too late on in her pregnancy to have one and then she was going to give himup fpr adoption but as soon as he was born she loved him and couldn't bear to give him up and know she's a great Mum. Being a good mother mainly depends on what you are like with you're child after birth.
feel_1323	feel	Did you think we'd all catch your deliberate misuse of words or are you a blonde?  ...can't be both!  Both men and women have been denigrated and made fun of for centuries...men are just better at denigrating and making fun.  I think the Cherokee Indians had the right idea.emoticonXGood
feel_428	feel	I pretend I'm rich and famous that way being surrounded by firepower don't bother me as much and I feel better about it.;)
feel_372	feel	"And, Master Shake, why is it precisely that you are having problems with ""women's issues""?"
feel_414	feel	"Again, if it were only that simple.  I don't have the ""obligation to respect the choices"" of those who infringe upon the rights of another. Rapists make a ""choice."" Murderers make a choice, molesters make a choice... Are you ""obligated to respect their choices,"" Chester?  Maybe in the sense that they are free to make ""choices."" You are.  On that we will agree.   But I expect we don't always agree on what the consequences should be for some of the choices people make."
feel_1492	feel	How would gay marriage undermine heterosexual marriage?
feel_400	feel	Oh but that's just too good to resist.... I'll just mention one word: Mexicans....
feel_1486	feel	Wow, make up your mind. Either populations change over time (evolve) or they don't.       Would your wingless beetles be able to produce wings again if they were somehow beneficial again? You are starting to sound like Darwin and his finches.
feel_366	feel	"Well first off, again, you asked a misleading question. Jesus didn't just happen in the last century, nor in the last decade. Besides, God Rapes an unmarried Jew and gets away with a violent crime?!?  And people wonder why I'm such a skeptic.  I've never bought the whole ""emaculate conception"" jazz to begin with."
feel_1487	feel	As metioned in a post above mine, these verses prove nothing, and they certainly do not suggest creationism.
feel_401	feel	The main cause of so much hate and disrespect is the phony war we're fighting and our tactics in violation of international law, our attitude of superiority in the world, and our outright bullying of others, all of which are being pushed the most by -- you guessed it -- not liberals.
feel_367	feel	You know I'm not saying that.    Is there no alley you'd avoid given the chance?    Was she looking for trouble?   Police would certainly want to know what she was doing there.
feel_373	feel	no, that's not what I mean. It's not like it's fine to kill anything. I'm not going to walk up to someone in a coma and kill them just because they can't control their actions and think as good as everyone else. It's just better than walking up to a person walking down the road and stabbing them in the back. It's just if you got pregnant 'cause of rape or something, don't you think it would be better toget an abortion when the baby can't really think, etc. I know it's still bad, but it's better. That's all I think she's trying to say, and if not, that's what I say. I mean, if a 12 year old got pregnant 'cause someone raped her, don't you think she should get an abortion, and the earliest the better?

How is it right now for 13,14 and 15 year old kids to make such adult decisions without their parents knowing ? Are you suggesting that 13 year old girls are mature enough emotionally to make such adult decisions about getting an abortion ?  And if so, do you then also believe that a 13-15 year olds should be allowed to adopt a child ? Or to enter into a contract to purchase a home or car ? Because those are also adult decisions and it doesn't seem reasonable to me that we should allow them to slide on emotionally damaging decisions about sex or abortions and then insist they're not mature enough to participate in other adult decisions. Kids need consistency in order to grow up to be responsible adults and by your way of thinking, you will just add more confusion and insecurity in an already difficult time in an adolescents life.

feel_950	feel	"I think there's a few points to be made here -  1) This is a forum specifically for the purpose of discussing God and religion. Thousands, hundred's of thousands, maybe even billions of people who don't believe in God haven't bothered to seek it out, they have no interest, it attracts those that do have an interest in learning how and why others think and do as they do.  2) Discussing something, no matter what the reason or how much it is discussed, does not lend any validity to what is being discussed. There is an infinite number of examples I could give to illustrate that point. Take in a sci-fi convention some time as a prime example.  3) I don't see so much the discussion of ""is there a God/isn't there a God"", as I do the discussion of religion and the Bible. That is a very important distinction. Religion is very real, and affects all of us, whether we are believers in it or not. Whether or not Bigfoot exists, or the Klingons are invading someone, has no bearing whatsoever on my life or reality, religion does. I think that is the reason you see such fervent discussion and rejection of Christianity on forums like this. Why the large outcry? Those in the minority always tend to be more vocal, they have to be, or they'd simply be overwhelmed by the ""silent"" majority.  Waxy  P.S. Don't sell yourself short, you more than hold your own on these forums."

feel_207	feel	And what of when you go by some moral standard to determine what is right and wrong in other peoples' lives as well? What? you don't do that? Bull. You can't tell me you never have an opinion or judgment on anything anyone else does. But by your logic, that would be imposing on them.  Sorry, that dog just doesn't hunt. Everyone has some basis for the views they have about they way they think society would be best. There's no law that says people can't participate in that process with religion or anything else as their moral basis. 'Imposing religion' is not the same as using religion as a basis, and it's the fact that you are wrong on this that's why religious people are continually able to have religion as their basis of social change, just as equally as anything else.

All these miracles, and others, embody the personally comforting notion that for special people, the universe makes exceptions. This is a common feature of religions, from the oldest to the newest, ever since we were first intelligent enough to appreciate at a conscious level that there were things in the world we didn't understand and couldn't control and which didn't seem to care very much about us, like lightning or crocodiles.   As members of a species who have evolved the habit of ingratiating ourselves with other, more powerful members by making the right sounds and employing properly deferential body language, the idea of being able to employ the same techniques to get the uncaring forces of nature on your side is a powerfully seductive one. Certainly it's more palatable than believing that sometimes the crocodile is already full when you happen to take a dip, and sometimes it is not.  Gotta go, back later.

feel_1644	feel	"When the founding fathers determined that religion should not be established, nor prohibited from being freely exercised, they probably wouldn't have considered atheism (the assertion that there is no God) to be a religion, because at the time it wasn't organized, or funded. The Judeo Christian religions were organized and funded at the time, as were other types of religion. They weren't concerned with what beliefs majorities or minorities had, they were concerned with impositions a religion could put on segments of the population with their organizational requirements, or money issues. They could see atheists needing protection from religion, but they couldn't see religion needing protection from atheism, because it wasn't organized. While it can be argued that atheism is not a religion, it can't be argued that it isn't an EQUIVALENT to religion today, with the organization and funding that it now has. 200 years ago, an organization needed buildings and meetings and transportation to be organized. With today's communications, it does not. Just type ""atheism"" in any search engine and note the organization, and political action.   I'm not using the term ""atheism"" in a derogatory manner. It's an assertion that there is no God. But today it's every bit as organized and politically active as any religion - it has happened practically overnight, thanks to modern communications. It now has the same ability to impose itself on society exactly like religion, and is covered by the first amendment the same as any religion. It cannot claim science as its god, and force it upon public education.  3) One of the most interesting things about this whole issue is the fact that the same thing, only reversed, was going on in the US 100 years ago.   http://www.campusmagazine.org/articl...2-2f7cc3afdb0f  The concept of evolution was recently founded at that time, and some closed minded religious people were afraid of it, and vehemently opposed having it taught in schools. Today, the concept of intelligent design, (void of any certain religion and its associated faith) is vehemently opposed by closed minded Darwinists, who are afraid of it in exactly the same way.  I suspect the same thing was at the root of it all 100 years ago just like today - concerns of how the money flows. Religious leaders seek funding - secular science seeks funding.   If I would have been alive 100 years ago, would I have opposed having evolution taught in schools? Of course I would have, because I wouldn't have been able to forsee how the benefits that the study of microevolution, genetics, and other non controversial aspects of evolution have benefited society. Chances are there are equal, undiscovered things about intelligent design that could be discovered it we would give it a chance.   In the words of biologist Arthur Jones;"

At least Iâm not advocating hauling astronomy to court and getting it thrown out of significant parts of the public realm. Do you think theyâre all genuinely mystified that someone would suggest that other branches of science be held to the same criteria that evolutionists have set for ID? This thread wouldn't exist without it, a lot of controversy wouldn't exist without it, the thoughtfulness and usefulness of science has been thrown into confusion just because militant atheists found a branch of it they didn't personally like, and emotionally set criteria for it that they don't want applied to other branches of it that they do like.

feel_628	feel	"I disagree, it depends on the nature of insult.  ""You suck! What kind of a dumb name is 'Robbie' anyway?"" Hardly requires a stretching of the old grey matter. But the snappy one-liner and the witty retort, or just a carefully crafted insult all require a fair amount of intelligence and insight.  Flat out denial requires least thought. I.e. ""you're wrong!"", ""you're wrong 'cos God says so!"" ""You're wrong 'cos Dawkins says so!"

It lives off her life processes - her blood, her immune system, her calories - it puts stress on her joints, muscles, heart, and bladder. Pregnacy can demand major sacrifices in behavior and diet - some of which can be detrimental. No a baby isn't the woman's body - but a pregnancy IS.

That is ridiculous because if it's true then, we oughta take every person who's in the throws of Alzhiemers out and euthanize them because they can't remember what they did yesterday. Just because you can't remember what you did at 4 doesn't negate for one moment that you still existed at 4 so your existence had value and substance even though you can no longer remember what happened back then in your life.
feel_1255	feel	One has to wonder why gun haters always ask this quesion.   Has this question ever been asked of people that read books? It is interesting how people that want to ban the right to bear arms never apply their logic to the rights they like. The gun haters clearly like the 1st amend.   The gun haters use their 1st amend right to attack the right to bear arms. When racist use their 1st amend right to attack other peoples right it is called hate speech. So why is it that gun haters demanding the banning of the right to bear arms is not considered hate speech? After all gun haters are just like the other hate groups. All they do is attack the right to bear arms. Not once has a gun hater ever demand that dangerous criminals be punished.

Everyone always says ""what if they get raped? Would you have the baby?"" Well for one only 1% of abortions are done because of rape. Secondly if you are raped you can go to the hospital and tell them what happened and they will do an emergency IUD. Why does the women get to choose who can come into the world? They are going to kill it and they don't care. You never knew what the baby could have been. They could have been the one to find the cure to cancer, aids, or another uncurable disease. Your not giving the baby a chance and that is wrong and not fair. Thats my opinion."

I can see that   interior to logical reasoning, ""necessity"" must exist in every reality - otherwise   what we understand as ""logic"" would not be that but something else.  To simplify:   All my friends are Irish  Sheila is my friend  So Sheila is Irish.   (The same sort of logical necessity applies (I think) to propositions involving  mathematics: 6+2 = 8 cannot be refuted because 6+2 is just another way  of writing 8.)  As Sheila exists in the real world, the information about her contained in the  syllogism also happens to be factually true.  But the necessary truths of logic including the proposition that God exists,  are deduced from applying the rules of logic and are not necessarily factual  truths and seem to have the same status as Sheila would if she existed only as an idea."

feel_1385	feel	"The definition of manslaughter is when one's actions, which end up killing someone, display a reckless disregard for the dangers of the situation. That's not a proper legal definition, but it'll do.  Now, you want to argue that pro-lifers would be forced into the counterintuitive conclusion that ALL miscarriage is manslaughter, and thus their position is ridiculous. I'm saying that they would only be forced to admit that a very small portion of miscarriage is manslaughter, and a portion that they would probably be willing to make a case for.  I'm not saying ""miscarriage is not manslaughter,"" but only ""miscarriage is not always manslaughter."" For example, if a woman took perfectly good care of herself and did nothing dangerous, but had a miscarriage anyway, she would obviously not have committed manslaughter. If a woman had one drink with dinner, but she was carrying a very unhealthy fetus and it died, then she would not have committed manslaughter, because that was not reckless. I pointed out the ""you-shouldn't-be-drinking-and-having-unprotected-sex"" argument as a position somebody might hold, but I think that it would probably be judged as unrepresentative of the definition of manslaughter.   So obviously, miscarriage cannot be manslaughter in the sense of ""every instance of A is an instance of B."""

It appears that your beef is with the prestige associated with being able to say ""We're married."" as opposed to recognizing yourselves as ""same-sex couples with all the rights and privileges afforded married couples"".  The fact is that people are not prohibited from being married because of their sexual orientation. A gay man can marry any woman that will have him. A lesbian can marry any man that will have her. You are not denied the right to marry...so long as you comply with the rules of marriage...including the one about one male and one female.  Changing definitions just to satisfy the ego of any one group is patently ridiculous. One might ask why we can't call ourselves female when we are actually male or why males shouldn't be allowed to enroll in an all girls school.  If it benefits you want, have at it.

You don't believe in parallel universes because there is no proof, yet you believe in God. Where is your proof there and there not proof for parallel universes. If you want to know what I believe, I really believe that what happens after death is irrelevant. I'm going to live based on what I know. I know that I am alive (or think I am). I know how to live it to the fullest (and it doesn't involve church or praying). I will live the way I want to which is probably very similar to the way you live yours. I haven't killed anyone, I try not to lie, I don't steal. I have probably about the same morals you do, except for one thing. I don't derive these morals from the fact that if I don't live by them I will burn in hell. I live by them because I know they are the right thing to do. I will not live my life out of fear, I will live my life the best way I know how based on what I know. If there's a god, he shouldn't have a problem with how I'm living my life and if he does have a problem, I don't want to listen to him anyway.

Retail establichments are able to decide fro themselves what they carry, the governemtn has no place in such decisions. If they decide not to carry the pill, or the pharmacist simply decides they are not going to dispense it, that is their right.

Are you then saying that if the cult of the tape worm arises, then their religious belief should then be forced upon those who suffer from tape worms.  Yes I know there is a difference between fetuses and tape worms but the principle is the same. Is someone elses religious belief more important then to be secure in your person and body?

feel_103	feel	The terrorists saw it as absolutly necessary. Personally, I disagree. When we kill children in Iraq, we see it as absolutly necessary, call it a horrible side effect of war. I disagree on that, too, I don't think it is necessary at all.
feel_665	feel	But what's best for society is usually best for me, and so I am not disqualified from this debate. That's why I keep pointing out why it would be a bad thing to enslave people or oppress people because it hurts everyone in the end. That's what causes wars and crime a lot of the time. So yeah, I do go with what's best for me, but why should I go with any other way?  If I was a fetus, well who knows what I'd think. That's a whole other debate that some other people have already gotten into but which I think is kind of pointless. My whole point is that we kill people every day whether you like it or not, so this whole right to life thing is nonsense. You may not be the one pulling the trigger, but you always contribute to deaths. But we try to select which deaths we cause so that those deaths will lead to the most happiness for everyone else. And I think that allowing abortion does lead to more happiness for society. And before you try to show me polls about abortion to prove that many people disagree with it, and so it causes them unhappiness, that's not the only thing I'm talking about. I'm talking about the unhappiness of the child born into an ungrateful family, the potential criminal problems, and all the other things that have already been mentioned. And yes, those are only potential problems, but that's how society works. We give people jobs based on their percieved potential, we admit people to college based on potential. You have to go with the odds, it's simply how life works.

This is an attempt to take the moral high-ground, and is itself highly deceitful, especially in light that you have in the past accused me of saying things that I didn't... see our discussions re: Archie, the transitional bird-beast.  Also, you name-call, and then chuck a tantrum if anyone does the same back.  I must say here that I do wish you'd stop personalising this, as it only leads to more confrontation, not discussion.

By definition of reason, it is the intellectual faculaty by which conclusions are drawn from premises. On the existence of a rational Creator who made us in His image, our ""intellectual faculty"" would also be made in His image. Thus it is rational and logical. Hence, the conclusion that we come to from the premise that God exists is rational and logical. While evolution says we are accidents, and hence, our brain patterns that governs our logic and ability to reason must also be accidnets (i.e we would be irrational and illogical). After reasoning, the conclusions we came to would be most likely irrational and illogical.  As you can see from the definition of reason, it depends on your starting faith or belief systems as to what conclusion you will come to. Another word for this faith is assumptions."

feel_249	feel	You blame others for your failure to understand the basics.
feel_513	feel	"Just as you have a background in science Frog, I also have an extensive background in Christianity. A brief synopsis: starting at birth I was without consent given the supposed ""gift"" of Catholic faith. In highschool I met a kid and later on a girlfirend who were both Born Again Christians. I thought I'd dabble in it. The girlfirend and I went our seperate ways, but I remained a Christian and began studying the Bible. The transformations in me were mostly bad and far beyond the scope of this (we can discuss it on a different forum), but one important thing occured when I began studying the Bible in earnest. I found holes and flaws too big to be ignored. Don't ask me what they were because, again, this is not the religious forum and I'd be hard pressed to even tell you what they were, but I assure you there was a time I could quote them chapter and verse. Since that time I have tried my best to forget it. I realized that my error was the attempt to literally interpret the Bible. I knew that if I pulled back from that, attempting instead to decipher the good message of the scriptures, I could perhaps save my Christian faith. But I didn't want to become an apologist. So, in my mind I travelled east. I dabbled in Taoism and Buddhism which appealed very much to my love of Asian history. After a year or two of this, when I discovered there was also a strict theology behind these Asian religions, and it was not just a matter of reading Thomas Merton, meditating and burning incense, I realized that I had been acting like a rich divorced woman with much too much time on her hands (Think of the British sitcom ""Absolutely Fabulous"" --- greatest show of all time after Seinfeld), and that if you're really goign to commit yourself to something you need to do more than scratch the surface. It was then, when all religious answers seemed to elude me, that I subscribed to agnosticism: athiesm with a parachute as my old English professor used to say. And on that note I remain today. I don't know the answer and therefore will not comment. Through all of it, however, one philosophy has given me freedom: the beginning of wisdom can be found in the notion that we don't have the answers. Do you say I have the answers because men wrote them in a book nearly 2000 years ago, and I can take their word for it? Hell, Frog, I don't take the word of a man who writes the answers in a book today, let alone 2000 years ago. I open the newspaper always skeptical. If you tell me something, you'd better be able to support it.  Now what I do believe is an entire scientific community which can back up their claims, publish them and open up their work for anyone else in the world with the means to duplicate these tests (or subject a hypothesis to a different test of their own design).   The problem with the Bible is that its primary source of evidence is the Bible. A bad comparison, but a comparison nonetheless would be my writing a book and telling you that book is the truth because I say so. Exceprts from the Bible which may point to actual historical events or documented figures do not by rote prove that Jesus walked on water. I call Bible-thumpers mindless because this has been my experience, Frog. Up close and personal. They think inside the very tiny box of their scriptures and ask that we accept it by faith. But the basis by which we're really accepting it is widescale social acceptance. If enough people, enough books, enough teachers point to this single source and say ""it is truth,"" then the cud-chewing masses will usually fall in line. But that doesn't necessarily mean I am going to buy it. I would prefer listening to people, books and teachers who point to many different sources and say this is truth. If I want to see evidence of the Bible I can read the Bible. If I want to see evidence of evolution I can visit our excellent museum of natural history here in Pittsburgh. If I want to discuss evidence of the Bible I can talk to someone who has read the Bible. If I want to discuss evidence of evolutoin I can talk to someone who has read books from many different disciplines of scientific thought. If I want to challenge myself with new questions about the Bible I can open the Bible. If I want to challenge myself with new questions about evolution I can go outside, take a walk in the woods, scribble in my notebook and come back to this forum with a 47 page post full of questions: the important point here being that others like Lurch and Demon would either be able to answer them or point me in the right direction of someone who can.

But the bias of the church against homosexuality is based of a small passage of text which, it seems, cannot be interpreted away. That part that condemns homosexuality is accurate, straight-from-gods-mouth truth. Again, why the dichotomy? Why are some parts of the bible open to interpretation, but others are rigid?"

The idea is that if men are held responsible for abortions, then they will put on a condom instead of taking the chance,... and hence.. reduce the abortions or the need there of, and this would incourage them to marry.
feel_729	feel	That is merely your interpretation of my actions here, and does not reflect my personal motivations. You don't like it that I disagree with you, and from the options available to explain that disagreement you alternately choose 'Peeling is stupid/simple minded' and 'Peeling is driven by an emotional, philosophical imperative' - the former because it's always a handy and ego-inflating explanation for disagreement and you don't have any respect for other people's intellect anyway, and the latter because it's understandable and familiar to you.  I disagree with you because the logic you have used to prop up your assertion that your philosophy mirrors reality is clearly faulty. The evidence you provide to support your case actively harms it. It's not that you're certainly wrong, just that you don't have to be right for the evidence we see to add up.   I don't think you're stupid by any means; the skill with which you have manipulated our discussions has been considerable. I do think you are ignorant of much that would beneficially inform your hypotheses, that you cherry-pick just that evidence which seems to support your preconceptions rather than critically applying your hypothesis to all the available evidence, and I do think that your intellect is being leveraged in pursuit of the wrong goal, namely the creation of a fortress of semantics, idiosyncratic terminology and untestable assertions from within which you can hurl abuse at others.  You may disagree with my assessment - fine. I am at least doing you the courtesy of believing you when you say you formulate EAM with the express intention of promoting your personal philosophical views about life.

There is no scientific basis that it's a human person, at the stage of development when the vast majority of abortions occur. I worry that by suggesting it's so negative, it can't help but be a stigma on the woman who chooses to abort her pregnancy. No woman should feel the need to apologize in relation to abortion, which is just about control over one's own body.
feel_1630	feel	My apologies. The whole point: There is NO answer.

feel_488	feel	"I think this is the crux of our disagreement. In my line of reasoning, I believe since criminals are obviously using firearms, the refusal to allow lawful citizens the same means of defense is unreasonable and unfair.  Good people are required to ""bring a knife to a gunfight"". (i.e. disproportionate response)  While I believe that any law abiding citizen should be able to have access to the means to defend themselves, I think a reasonable compromise is possible between our two sides.  How's this:   Instead of a complete ban, you concede that civilian gun ownership is a good thing and allow the reasonable ownership of handguns for personal protection.  Instead of lassiz' faire ""guns for all who want them"", I'll concede that a strict regimen of licencing and training/qualification for those who wish to purchase. (In the U.K. Although this is reasonable, I'm not going for it in the U.S. This would be a HUGE concession to government control here.)  A strict licencing/registration scheme would be allowing for MORE freedom in the U.K. It would be tightening a ""Nazi-like"" noose around our necks here in the U.S.  If you are being burned at the stake, lethal injection sounds like a wonderful alternative.

feel_311	feel	Because if you let gays marry because it is an alternitve way the equal protection says that if you let one happen you have to let the others have that right to. But that is not really my point my real point is that if we let this happend it will ruin marriage in this country, marriage is a bond between a man and a women and if we let gays marry this country will be ruining that tradition thus making this country more secular then it all ready is.

If there is falsehood in it then how can any of it be trusted? If the Creation, Adam and Eve, Noah and the ark are just there to serve as the only form capable of transmitting these truths from generation to generation. That is Absolutly ridiculous. Why stop with that? Why not continue on to say that the story of Jesus was jsut a way for man to relate to God? Oh but then it continues doesnt it? Yes it does! Nothing in the bible is to be beleived unless it is all beleived as a whole. It is torn apart.   You cannot pick and choose parts of this religion as it fits your needs.

feel_83	feel	Well, you are apparently admitting that I am correct in that we do not know for sure. What God has to do with it I do not know, because I did not bring that side of the debate up. My argument is purely of logic and philosophy.  Consider for a second that you are wrong, and that abortion really is the killing of thousands and thousands of people. Then is abortion a woman's right? Of course not. No one has the right to take a life for the sake of convenience (I'm not talking about aborting because the mother's life is at stake, for now just clear-cut convenience). So you commit a logical fallacy by assuming women have this right, because you assume that people are not being killed, while you provide zero hard evidence that this is the case. So, once again you are risking thousands and thousands of lives based on a hope.
feel_106	feel	Oh! Goody! At last someone who wants to actually discuss evolution instead of mythology!

I think the Pro-lifers have an edge on the contradiction between abortion and the death penalty because one is the ending of an innocent life, while the other is of a guilty personâs life. I think every soldier who gives his life in a justified or an ambiguous war should be honored by all Americans for giving his or her life for their country, and yes, I do believe they are patriots!

Do a search for ""effects of abortion"" on the Web and see if you don't find many more studies with the same results. I could have posted many more links. Maybe you don't know about these studies since the leftist media and women's groups tends to ignore them. Maybe you just ignore them because they don't fit into your world view.

feel_461	feel	Indeed the court's reasoning may have been as racist as your own.   Indeed, the article describes how the court's reasoning was even a surprise to the police officers' attorney because it was so out of line with what is expected of conduct during arrests.  She was not violent and she had an obvious health condition.  Whatever you think about what she was intending to do or not -- though she communicated quite clearly -- is rather irrelevant given the offense and those surrounding circumstances.  I bet this is your opinion ANY time the story concerns a black defendent and a white police officer. Because you're a racist.

Some defender of marriage!   This is a classic example of someone needing to get the log out of his own eye."

feel_105	feel	"Well, its not just morally wrong in America, but its morally wrong in the middle east as well.

Honestly though, do you think you would care more if it were blacks or jews being killed rather than feti and embryos? I'd certainly hope so...if you condemn abortion clinic bombers you are setting a certain double standard.   I just don't think that a potential person can ever outweigh the wants and needs of an existing one, and 99% of the time pro-lifers agree. Soon as you realise that its not actually 'babies' being aborted then its a lot harder I think to hold a universally pro-choice opinion
feel_57	feel	More evidence of your selfish motives, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but it sort of disqualifies you from being objective and reasonable about the abortion issue. Its obvious if you were in the fetus' position, you'd be against abortion. I seem to detect a lot of abiguity and contraction on where you stand on this
feel_1140	feel	So put the criminals to death, don't let them see daylight again.
feel_43	feel	So you're accusing me of the thing that your most guilty of?

feel_1626	feel	The idea of abortion as population control is absurd, especially forced abortions as someone mentioned a few posts ago. Anyone who has read a biology book knows the world has methods of population control on its own, we don't need to be doing stuff like that ourselves.

Well, I could just post the above, but SS would no doubt jump up and down having a hissy fit about how I ""wasn't able"" to counter his points. So here's a short list:      * Selection does not require inability to breed, only differential breeding rates.  * Ring species demonstrate precisely what SS asserts doesn't exist.  * Selection is not survival of the fittest. Although much better descriptions exist, it could better be described as ""statistically preferential perpetuation of the fittest.""  * Many primates fight within their own tribes to gain dominance. Infanticide is common. Do you consider this ""for the benefit of the population""?  * Even were there universal cooperation among populations, that wouldn't prevent differences in fitness.  * SS provides no quote or citation for the alleged assertion that [a certain occurrance of] evolution could never happen the same way twice.  I would also like to point out that once again we have a broken link that shows that not only is supersport simply copying and pasting his baloney, his common sense is so lacking that after being called on this numerous times, he doesn't even pay attention to the problem.

My answer was to demand that they ban some versions of the Bible because they told of how Abraham tied his XXX to a tree and Jesus sat on his XXX in Jerusalem. Didn't phase them.

fact_693	fact	But in the context of Debaterâs usual arguments on this board, one might presume that he is trying to imply that somehow a âsideâ that he favors is not being given a fair hearing. It seems to be an echo of the oft expressed creationist cry that it is only fair that if a scientific theory that they oppose on religious grounds is presented in science class, i.e., evolution, then their side should also be presented on a equal basis with science.  I thought it might be of some interest to understand Jeffersonâs motivations behind the above quote.  After Jefferson left office and retired to Monticello he continued to do business with a bookseller in Philadelphia named N. G. Dufief. Apparently on some occasions, Jefferson would purchase books that were sent directly to him at Monticello and Mr. Dufief would act as Jeffersonâs agent for payment. Jefferson would then, from time to time, settle accounts with Mr. Dufief.  That seems to have been the case with a book by M. de Becourt entitled, Sur la CrÃ©ation du Monde, un SystÃªme d'Organisation Primitive. Jefferson had seen notice of the bookâs publication and presumed it to be ââ¦either a geological or astronomical work.â He ordered it to be sent to him upon publication with instructions that Mr. Dufief be contacted for payment. Thus, Mr. Dufief became involved with a book that he had never seen. Mr. Dufief extended credit to Mr. Jefferson, as was his custom, and paid for the book.  But such little technicalities never stopped the forces of good in the community. From the title alone criminal charges were brought against Mr. Dufief for crimes against religion. I do not know to outcome of the case but presume that Mr. Dufief was acquitted. The quote that Debater got almost correct is from a letter that Jefferson wrote to Dufief about the matter. At the end of the letter Jefferson discusses settling accounts by adding the unknown price of Newtonâs Principia to his balance of $4.93 and sending it along to Philadelphia.  Here are Jeffersonâs comments on the case of Mr. Dufief from a letter of April 19, 1814.

fact_1234	fact	You either did not read my post thoroughly, or are intentional misrepresenting me. Post 250 (which I had actually read before starting this thread) is nothing but DamEtel rambling about homologies between vertebrae embryos. That has absolutely nothing to do with the unexplained homologies that the Denton talks about. Evolution simply cannot, reasonably speaking, account for the homology between your arm and leg, among other examples.
fact_136	fact	"Again you focus on irrelevant minutia in the hope of making excuses and justifying the actions of someone who was clearly in the wrong. Here again is what the Judges said in their ruling, one being a fellow woman whom you are calling a racist, and it doesn't bode well for your law suit partial criminal: But in a 2-1 ruling Friday, a panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals disagreed. Judges Cynthia Holcomb Hall and Diarmuid F. O'Scannlain held that the officers were justified in making an arrest because Brooks was obstructing them and resisting arrest.  The use of force was also justified because of the threat Brooks posed, Hall wrote: ""It seems clear that Brooks was not going to be able to harm anyone with her car at a moment's notice. Nonetheless, some threat she might retrieve the keys and drive off erratically remained, particularly given her refusal to leave the car and her state of agitation."""
fact_888	fact	And yet, many animals survive by instinct only, having been abandoned by their mother at birth. Wouldn't you think that with that capacity to survive without guidance that they would also have the capacity to learn new things from one generation to another as humans do, resulting in true intellectual evolution over the past 100 million years or so?

fact_644	fact	I'm sure you're very well aware that evolution does not and cannot work like that. There was never any necessity that membrane proteins like proteorhodopsin in bacteria would one day evolve into the rhodopsin we use to see with: it was of benefit to the bacteria, and that's enough for natural selection.
fact_122	fact	Really? Let's consider the matter of Jesus' claimed virgin birth, a claim brought forth by Matthew long after Paul's time. Here's Paul on the subject...  Rom 1:3 Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh;  ...which suggests that Paul considered Jesus' conception to be fairly routine. EZ, evidence contained within the NT points to a gradual evolution of Christology over a considerable period of time.

fact_2265	fact	Comments about asexual reproduction are not relevant. The statement is true, and again one of Darwin's observations. The later part of the statement is a reference to a popular evolutionary philosophy during the latter half of the 19th century, essentialism. Except for creationists, essentialism was debunked and cast aside during the years of the synthesis.

fact_1036	fact	"Then a man who needs an artificial heart to survive is a new species of man. That is the analogy I gave, and you ignored.  In both cases; human and bacteria, before the advent of a human product, a particular group of individuals from each larger group would die off.  BUT along come a man-made invention that allows those certain portions to live on which otherwise would have died. In once case - nylon, the other, the artificial heart. You call this evolution.  Nor is it 'natural selection' at work either, as in both cases the thing that enabled them to survive was not natural. What you have advanced as a proof of evolution actually proves what? Natural what? I suppose people with cochlear implants are new species too because they've learnt to hear.  Another view of this nylon-eating-bug is given...  ""Finally, Mr Cerutti is out of date about this new nylon digesting ability allegedly from a frame shift. New evidence shows that the ability was due to plasmids [e.g. K. Kato, et al., ?A plasmid encoding enzymes for nylon oligomer degradation: Nucleotide sequence analysis of pOAD2?, Microbiology (Reading) 141(10):2585?2590, 1995.] In fact, more than one species of bacteria have the ability, residing on plasmids. This suggests that the information probably already existed, and was just passed between different types of bacteria.""   ""All that would be needed to enable an enzyme to digest nylon is a mutation causing loss of specificity in a proteolytic (protein-degrading) enzyme. This may seem surprising? How would a loss of information create a new ability? Answer: enzymes are usually tuned very precisely to only one type of molecule (the substrate). Loss of information would reduce the effectiveness of its primary function, but would enable it to degrade other substrates, too. Since both nylon and proteins are broken down by breaking amide linkages, a change in a proteolytic enzyme could also allow it to work on nylon. If this process were continued, the result would be a general enzyme with a weakly catalytic effect on the hydrolysis of too many chemicals to be useful where much selectivity is required. To put it into perspective, acids and alkalis also catalyze many hydrolysis reactions, but they also lack specificity. Indeed, an inhibitor of a protein degrading enzyme also inhibits the action of the nylon degrading enzyme""  http://www.answersingenesis.org/home...e7-24-2000.asp  Talkorigins gave their usual doubletalk  ""Whilst this particular case does not ""prove"" evolution, it is consistent with, and supportive of, the theory of biological evolution.""  Why do they say this? Because it's still a bacteria. It's not like it suddenly became a large multi-cellular organism. But it might just prove that this bug was so well designed that it can cope with newer situations. One site does say that it, the bacteria, had the capability already within it of change ? not resultant in ?mutations?, but more like switching on previously dormant apparatus. http://members.tripod.com/aslodge/id89.htm  One poster on another forum summed the problem up like this...  "" In order for species to advance there would have to be a net information gain, which isn't the case with nylon eating bacteria.  The bacteria gained the ability to digest nylon, therefore was able to survive in a new environment. Two distinct advantages  But, the bacteria lost its ability to survive in its old environment, eat its former diet and suffered a 98% loss in efficiency. Three disadvantages.  So by taking two steps forward and three steps backward, where is the net gain?   If nylon eating bacteria was ""proof"" of evolution, we would still be pond scum, but with the ability to digest whatever happened to become the primary food source.""  http://www.christianforums.com/t52336"
fact_1750	fact	evidently not. You have been unable to present me with any scientific evidence that mutations can create the raw material for which natural selection (which also doesn't exist) would act.  This renders your theory scientifically worthless and more along the lines of astrology or palm reading.
fact_1988	fact	They still have a lower rate of unwanted preganacies than the USA.
fact_2259	fact	Because if evolution cannot explain all changes it is false, Unless you propose some creatures evolved and some were specially created. Is that what you mean?  Genesis says that all creatures were specially created. It fits with the observational evidence but there is no smoking gun that proves it.  Statis is the norm not the exception.  One is right the other wrong. It cannot be both ways.  Do you have an answer to how a lizard can morph into a bird considering the amazing difference in the lungs?
fact_1963	fact	"It's not just a kernel of uncertainty. Jews and Christians alike say that Moses wrote the Pentateuch, but a reading of the Pentateuch makes it obvious that this cannot be true. Luke did not write the book of Luke, the apostle Matthew did not write the book of Matthew, and we don't even claim to know the authors of many books of the Bible. Look up the Documentary hypothesis; early scholars shuffled ""holy writings"" together like a deck of cards to get the Old Testament that everybody today knows and loves."
fact_452	fact	Great insight and response to him. I too had my doubts about the veracity of the global warming claims at every level of the propaganda they have spewed from so many different sources, for so long. And those very sources have been exposed as participants in this scam now, which just makes my decade... emoticonXHoho Here's a link to a link I posted in the debate about the scam of carbon credits right here on 4forums back in January of 08, and an excerpt from that article. Read some of the defenders posts and look at the sources they rely on to justify the global warming scam. It's absolutely incredible how they just lap up the lies and follow the propaganda like lambs to the slaughter.  Will Media Report Global Warming 'Carbon Credit' Fraud?  By Noel Sheppard (Bio | Archive)  April 25, 2007 - 21:54 ET   Itâs conceivable that years from now, Americaâs media will be reporting one of the biggest frauds in history: the idea that a wealthy person, for instance, soon-to-be-Dr. Al Gore, can purchase âcarbon creditsâ to offset his lavish lifestyle making him quote âcarbon neutral.â  Given the mediaâs love affair with the former vice president as well as advancing man-made global warming hysteria, few American press members have dared to expose this hoax for what it is.  However, on Wednesday, an impeccably reputable publication, the Financial Times, published an article that is a deliciously inconvenient truth for folks like Gore, Laurie David, Sheryl Crow, and all the rest of the alarmists that are actively involved in what years from now will be considered one of the biggest scams ever (emphasis added throughout):  http://www.4forums.com/political/297828-post25.html
fact_334	fact	Based on what evidence can you make this conclusion?
fact_320	fact	Does any part of the theory of evolution give an accounting of how we transitioned from quadruped movements of the ape to biped?

fact_446	fact	Without guns? Like guns somehow suddenly stop existing?      The answer would be no, and it'll always be no.
fact_1787	fact	This is a false assertion. In our society, a woman is not obligated to care for a child after it is born, this is why adoption and safe-haven laws exist. The situation is different enough between a fetus and a born child that a direct moral comparison is impossible in this way.
fact_308	fact	Right. We are explaining natural phenomena by natural means. We do so simply because we can test natural explanations while we cannot test the supernatural. We use methodological naturalism (not, by any means, philosophical naturalism) to observe, test and explain the natural. This is not a denial of god or an assumption about the existance of a god. It is a recognition of the fact that we cannot investigate the supernatural by natural means. Even methodological naturalists can be theists - Kenneth R. Miller for example.
fact_1793	fact	But, of course, this is true of any test question in any science class. No test question in science ever asks for an opinion. They all ask for answers that confirm a knowledge of the science. The law is meant to intimidate teachers. But if a student expresses a religious opinion on a biology test, that opinion is actually irrelevant. The only consideration in grading the test is whether or not the correct answer was provided. The student may also give an answer based on religious mythology, but as long as the correct answer is given, the student passes. However, if a student answers all questions in a class of earth science or life science with religious mythology, that student fails. He/she isn't being penalized because he/she expressed his/her religious mythology, he/she is being penalized because he/she didn't answer the question correctly. Students are not asked to express opinions, religious or otherwise, on tests of knowledge of science. They are required to confirm that they have a grasp of the science.
fact_2305	fact	And it takes this long for the obvious to be said...      http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&cid=514&e=1&u=/ap/20050314/ap_on_re_us/gay_marriage
fact_14	fact	Well, that was badly stated. But we've been over this before and you still don't seem to grasp. No one claims that any particular living animal is descended from any particular fossil. However, given the nature of life that we do observe, where we can see many species of equus, 36 species of cat, 28 species of canid, 8 or 10 species of bear (with as many more extinct species), 850,000 species of beetle, and on and on, we conclude that life was similar in the past. And while we can look at a fossil species of theropod dinosaur and find many avian characteristics, we do not conclude that this fossil was ancestral to birds. But we know that there were probably many species of theropods that had avian characteristics, just like there are many animals with cat-like features. Recent discoveries are bearing out that conclusion. So we don't say that this fossil is ancestral to that fossil or to this living organism. But we do say that this fossil shows characteristics that we would expect in an ancestral form. Thus, Archaeopteryx is not claimed to be ancestral to birds - in fact, is is believed to have eventually gone extinct (in all three known species). What we do say is that Archaeopteryx shows characteristics of both theropod dinosaurs and birds. Is in one of a broad lineage of many species with such characteristics, at least one of which is ancestral to modern birds (but we can't determine which one or ones that might be).  And we haven't even gotten into the question of derived morphology. Why don't we assume that dogs are descended from some very dog-like artiodactyl? In fact, why do we conclude that these dog-like animals are, in fact, artiodactyls?

fact_2339	fact	Garbage pure and simple. Science is materialist and empirical by its very nature. A non-materialist science is a contradiction in terms and WW you are well aware of it. What you present as a threory is empirically false and you are well aware of that also.

fact_240	fact	This is obviously not talking about abortion.
fact_254	fact	And what dictates the cells activities?
fact_532	fact	Creationism is not something new, it was the prevailing view of scientists up until Darwin. None of them belived in a divine parrot that is just plain silly. In the crucible of natural science throughout the Middle Ages, the Scientific Revolution and well into the 19th century theology was the queen of the sciences. Now we subject students to higher math studies that they will most likely never use and speculations about conceptual mechanisms like natural selection that have no practical application. Naturalistic presumption has become sacrosanct in the rhetoric of the professional scientists who have been crystal clear on how they define creationism. You can ignore the statement by D.J.Futuyma and identical ones made by Gould, Mayr, Dawkins, Dobzhansky and others but not without departing from mainstream evolutionary biology.
fact_1803	fact	Demographics plays a role, but it does not explain away the whole shift in the numbers.
fact_1195	fact	"You know what? You're starting to remind me an awful lot of reverend Jackson and reverend Phlaeger (the one who said they were going to kill anyone that didn't support their ideas of gun control). The claimed that a gun shop owner was intentionally violating the laws of Chicago and selling all kinds of weapons to gang members, simply by being one mile outside of the Chicago city limits.  Your entire argument is that since there are firearms dealers within a certain distance to the Mexico/America border, then they must obviously be outfitting the mexican drug cartels.  You've hung yourself with this article you just posted, and I'm gonna explain why. The ATF has said there are 6,700 licensed dealers along the border, meaning they know exactly where they are. So why exactly isn't the ATF going in there and breaking them up for their illegal activities? After all if close proximity is an unquestionable sign of guilt, then the ATF must know that these guys are equipping mexican drug cartels with fully automatic machine guns (the kinds that the American people can't ever get) and grenades and rocket launchers, and maybe even the odd nuclear warhead.  The ATF shut down Red's Trading Shop on matters as insignificant as typos. So why aren't they going in and shutting down these rogue dealers if they're doing anything wrong? It's illegal to own an automatic weapon of any sort without a federal tax stamp, and it's not possible for civilians to own post-'86 model automatic weapons, so why isn't the ATF doing something about it if they're breaking the laws?  Seriously Aussie, what is it, is the ATF saying ""We know they're breaking the laws, but they're not doing anything illegal we can bust them on""?"
fact_268	fact	Well so is falling out of a building onto a piece of rebar. Or getting mashed in a car crash. There are a lot more of those than shootings but you don't seem to care. Why is that? Is it because you love to dance in blood?

fact_2107	fact	Actually, I had heard it several times on radio talk shows that normally do research before making claims. I then read it on several sites that cited the U.S. Census Records as their source. Since the radio shows and the websites all credited the U.S.Census, I perceived that they could not have made it up...since they all matched within acceptable tolerances. It does seem reasonable to you that such information could be gleaned from the census data...does it not?  Will you agree that what they say is true?
fact_2113	fact	I think we should argue that it's time to stop making people easy targets. The reason so many people are getting killed and victimized is because there are too many laws against self-defense, giving too much power to those that are fully intent on doing harm in an illegal manner.
fact_1354	fact	I think there are two separate questions here.  (1) When does personhood begin?  (2) Who gets to make such arbitrary, moral decisions on behalf of a pregnant woman?  Both are legitimate issues of contention. You can't just dismiss the one you don't want to argue as unimportant. There are lots of excellent arguments going every which way, and many of them are objectively unresolvable, such as the one pertaining to the onset of personhood. They are truly matters of opinion.  So, since there is obviously little agreement between people about when an egg and sperm become a person with full human rights, the practical question really is whose opinion matters most? The woman's, or the faceless bureaucrat's? emoticonXGood

fact_903	fact	I think you hit it pretty much on the money. Gun control does not cure anger, hate, and violence.  Talk about responsibility. Gun grabbers blame you and me and our behavior for the violence in this country. They blame everyone except the one who pulls the trigger and takes human life.
fact_1426	fact	"You're thinking is right on, sinjin.  Although it's kinda hush-hush, it has been determined (especially in the more charismatic churches) that when one ""goes further"" in religion the other feels alienated and problems/troubles that probably would have never risen in their relationship oozes out. A new circle of friends emerge which make the one that is âleft behindâ feel closed out and closed off. Arguments then seem to erupt daily and most of it over who is doing the âright thingâ according to that religion, followed all too often by divorce."
fact_917	fact	"Really?   If ""nature"" meant for all things to reproduce through heterosexual methods then maybe all other forms of reproduction would not exist, hmm. They would have been ""eliminated"" because heterosexuality is far superior. Think again. The majority of organisms on this planet reproduce using binary fission (bacteria dividing), asexual reproduction (there goes your ""individual gratification argument), and zygotic reproduction. None of these things require sexes of any type.   Even animals that have ""normal"" sexual reproduction can reproduce using a process known as parthenogenesis, in which only a female is required to produce offspring (turkeys and lizards do this). If homosexuality isn't natural or is inferior, then why do we see examples of it in nature. The bonobo (closely related to the chimpanzee) exhibits heterosexual and homosexual activity in both genders in the wild, and the bonobo and humans share a very common ancestor.   Look, you can't say that one way of reproduction is ""the standard"" since it is clear that different species reproduce in a variety of ways. You also can't say that homosexuality is a disorder if you follow your previous logic that what is ""natural"" is valid. Also, you said that heterosexuality is superior because it has a ""greater purpose"". By implying that something has a purpose, you stray from the realm of Science by assuming a teleology. If you want to assume that things were given ""purpose"" by some higher being, that's fine, but you'll have to stick to religion to defend your argument. In science, it is impossible to assume a purpose. For example, what is the purpose of a river? To flow to the ocean? To carve a canyon? To carry sediment? You can say what something is good at doing, or what it does, but you cannot say what it was ""made"" for (purpose) without implying some grand design that can be easily provided by your local religion. As for hetero and homosexuality, it can be said that heterosexuals are better at producing offspring than homosexuals. Does that automatically make heterosexuality superior based on the arbitrary criterion of number of offspring produced? So in the eyes of a value system that believes that something is valued higher that creates more offspring or ""life"", heterosexuality would be superior. But in the eyes of science and reason, your argument doesn't hold water."

Ill keep it to 2 for now"
fact_1383	fact	Actually, natural selection is one of the mechanisms of evolution. There is more to it than that, but creationists with limited knowledge can't figure that out.
fact_1382	fact	That's because it's not a falsifiable hypothesis. No matter what happens to an organism, you will always be able to say it happened on purpose.  The observations you cherry-pick are those you use when attempting to prove that darwinian evolution cannot work. So you ignore the countless studies where variation is unambiguously stochastic and focus on the very small number which seemed initially to show non-random mutation. You ignore the countless studies where adaptive mutations arise, and can be elevated by carcinogens, in the absence of any hypermutational organismic response, and focus only on those where it does occur.
fact_1396	fact	Well, yes, but this begs the question of whether, even assuming epigenetic inheritance is real, all individuals would experience the same epigenetic alterations.  Now, I have no problem with the concept of epigenetic inheritance. But even if it were true it wouldn't do away with natural selection. Just as with basic genetic mutation, which isn't going to go away, one would expect some individuals to exhibit epigenetic alterations and others not to. This still means a population containing a range of variants that natural selection can act on, preserving some epigenetic alterations as opposed to others.  Of course, if the claim is that epigenetic alterations are somehow directed by the environment, i.e. are teleological in origin, then the onus is on the advocates to demonstrate how this direction occurs. Until they do, there is no reason to suppose there is any direction at all.

fact_1341	fact	Because the location of the tracks used to be a tidal plane. In other words, it used to be at the edge of the ocean. Around that time the sea coast advanced and receded several times. The tracks were buried. The tracks actually had to be uncovered. The tracks were originally discovered immdiately after an unusually severe storm in the area in which an unusual amount of water came down the Paluxy. That unusual flow of water washed away the soil that covered some of the tracks. Other tracks have been intentionally uncovered. For example, in one case, where a trackway went under a bank, several feet of the bank was removed to expose more tracks.
fact_1355	fact	"Yes, exactly, lions/sea otters/seals/manatees/whales. Note that these creatures do not fit in a continuum of animals.

Otherwise, I see no reason to complicate this line of argument with side issues."
fact_902	fact	Exactly. That the change in moth color was due to natural selection was first posed in about 1896 by J.W. Tutt. The funny thing is that as pollution increased, the moths turned black, and then as the pollution was cleaned up, they turned white again. carbonaria have become pretty scarce.

fact_2112	fact	Because Satan is a fallen angel. He had a chance to be with God, but he didn't take it. He could go back to God any time he wanted to, but he doesn't want to. He has free will. God won't take that away, even though He can.
fact_1369	fact	I'm confused. Are you saying photo-sensitive bacteria aren't scientifically possible? Obviously, they evolved from bacteria without the ability to sense light. The mutation that allows a bacterium to sense light catches on with a generation, and natural selection takes hold. A population of bacteria would of course be better suited than another population if it could sense light. From there, it's a fairly obvious chain of events: photosensitivity becomes more efficient.
fact_2106	fact	And it contains many scientific and historic inaccurate lines in it. What was your point?
fact_1180	fact	What is a 'higher' species. If you mean a more intelligent primate?? The concept there is a hierarchy of 'higher' and 'lower' species is incorrect. The  only difference between man and the other primates is that man has a hyperdeveloped brain. There are two sugars that are naturally produced by body by most mammals. When investingating the presnece of these chemicals, one of them is present in much lower concentrations in the brains  of all mammals. However, humans have a mutation that interrupted the   production of this chemical. A piece of random junk got inserted into the middle of the gene that produces this chemical,and disabled it. Sometimes,  evolution is not so much about what is added, but what is removed.
fact_269	fact	"Not quite. To be more correct regarding government and guns, the right to own weapons is for the right to revolt and revolt with violence.  Our political philosophy is very clear on this:  ""that whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these Ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it"" - Declearation of Independace  You have the right to try and revolt with violence. You don't have the right to win a revolt."
fact_1194	fact	"Actually, you are still quibbling. First, after I told you that you were wrong you came up with the ""it may be in his diary"" bit. Later it has moved to an earlier version of OTOOS. The answer is quite simple. NOPE. I searched through The LIfe and Letters of Charles Darwin, vol I & II, More Letters of Charles Darwin, vol I & II, On the Origin of Species, 1st and 6th editions, The Autobiography of Charles Darwin, and The Voyage of the Beagle. None even contain the word ""microbiology"". Darwin made several references to microscopes and his use of them. He had one on the Beagle. But nowhere does any of that discussion refer to the impossibility of his theory.  Maybe you would be so kind as to tell me where you had access to Darwin's diary. Or maybe you either made up that assertion or were just an ignorant dupe of someone like Hovind making a claim like that. Where did it come from."
fact_255	fact	Well, if burglars want to steal guns then it makes sense that they would be likely to target the homes of gun owners. And the source is from the recently published book Evaluating Gun Policy which you can read and review. The source is listed at the bottom.
fact_1802	fact	While that may be true, it fails to show that reproduction is a requirement in order to call something living: that living things would disappear as a result of their not reproducing doesnât show that they are not living before they disappear.   [start: added 01/01/2006]  In fact, even with reproduction, organisms - such as leopards, elephants, whales, and so on - will eventually die out. Does that mean that they are not living organisms now? Of course not.

fact_527	fact	Private guns were completely private. They were personal property and could not be seized. It was the man that carried the weapon who was required to provide service, and required to provide his own weapon. Since the enrollment and inventory requirements were specifically to ensure that every man had his own private rifle, shot, powder, kit to fight with, it would seem rather stupid to worry that it was infringing on peoples right to bear arms, wouldn't it? Contrast this with today, where registration schemes have been used in places like new york to provide lists for seizure or surrender of firearms. In the one case, you have a law that is meant to insure that everybody has a weapon, i the other, it is a law determined to limit the accessibility of weapons. You really don't see the difference here?
fact_241	fact	So your point is that gun owners are terrorists?
fact_1143	fact	Well, I can tell you that 2+2=10, or indeed that 2+2=11, and be correct.

fact_29	fact	the bad thing about pregnancy is that it brings a life into the world. the most common reason for abortion is that the woman does not want the child. abortions that occur due to complications or medical risks to the mother or child make up less than 5% of the total.
fact_2338	fact	These two issues (abortion and sexual abuse among priests) are completely unrelated. The problems in one area have no bearing on the credibility the church has in the other. This is a classic case of a non-sequitur.
fact_1157	fact	So it's just as we've said: registration can and does lead to confiscation down the line. And now we have further proof that we're right about what we say.  Government gets the weapon registered, then they can, at any time and for any reason, demand it be surrendered to the authorities or else punishment will be administered.
fact_296	fact	The reason no one corrected him is because he wasn't wrong. Canis is the genus, lupus is the species-Canis lupus is a wolf. Canis familiaris is a domesticated dog.
fact_1619	fact	I know that I've tried to make this argument before on another thread but Jesus was not God in that sence but the Son of God. God even says in the Bible that Jesus is his son so that they are apart of eachother but are not the same. Also, how do you know that a lot of the laws put into Leviticus were not just ones added by the chief priest? After all, the Bible was writen down by human hands.  Also I want to make reference to John 3: 16-17 (TEV* translation)  16: For God loved the world so much that he gave his only Son, so that everyone who believes in him may not die but have eternal life.  17: For God did not send his Son into the world to be its judge, but to be its savior.  *I specify the translation because it seems that most of the posters are using KJV, which kind of annoys me when I try to read it.
fact_2310	fact	Yeah, but Herod isn't a demon: he's a human king.
fact_15	fact	Yes, I would stay out of it, unless I knew the woman, and she spoke up and asked me for an opinion, or advice. And even in the case of the woman being my best friend, and knowing all the different aspects to the situation, I still would not feel comfortable weighing in. Just like if it was me in the situation, I know that ultimately, it would be my decision, and I would have a right to that decision.
fact_2304	fact	Er, no. That is AnswersinGenesis' reasoning. Are you having difficulties reading? It seems so, as you are unable to distinguish between what a poster says and what an organization they are quoting says.
fact_282	fact	So does requiring everyone to go through a security check before boarding a plane suggest that nobody is capable of being trusted?
fact_1792	fact	It isn't a fraud. Why would you say that? And it isn't evidence for evolution, it is an observation of evolution. The allele frequency of the moths changed (twice) over time. The most reasonable explanation seems to be that it was the result of natural selection. Natural selection is one of several mechanisms of evolution.
fact_1786	fact	"Actually, no they could not find oil without evolution. It's not only a matter of finding ""certain rocks"" associated with oil, but by reconstructing the paleo-environment. Only certain environments, indicated by types of rocks and the types of animals/plants that existed at that time, are suitable for the production of petroleum.  In fact, a lot of mineral resources are located by certain geologic formations as interpreted by modern theories of geology. Without a knowledge of biological and geological evolution prospectors would waste a lot of time looking in the wrong places."
fact_309	fact	It isn't about truth. It is about explaining the evidence as best we can. You did get the second part correct about creationism. That is why some Christians are not creationists.
fact_321	fact	"Let me clear this up for you.  Wasteful DEFENSE spending is the only reason we have trouble funding the ""war on terror."" Which by the way has nothing to do with the $200b+ we have spent so far in Iraq (which is by no means the war on terror).   The entire budget of the EPA is only $7b? I would have thought it was more than that. (That would be 15% of the increase in the defense budget from 2002 to 2003 according to this page:  http://www.csbaonline.org/4Publicati...ense_Budge.htm  Titled:   2003 Defense Budget Request: Large Increase in Funding, Few Changes to Plans"
fact_447	fact	well yes that's what he did, but he did not try to present this as positive evidence for anything. the biomorphs were used to illustrate the point that random mutations are much more likely to produce beneficial results when the mutations are small.   analogies always break down at some level, this analogy was used to illustrate a certain point. the assertion that dawkins was suggesting that a biomorph happening to look like a real life object were proof that evolution and natural selection could produce such creatures is false.   montalban, to restore integrity i suggest you retract the conclusion you drew from snippets and quotes from dawkins as your paraphrasing was clearly not representative of dawkins' ideas.
fact_1976	fact	Here you're just flagrantly wrong. For info on the link between dinosaurs and birds, as an example, please follow this link and see the excellent post by pandion on this topic. And before we address the Big Bang, I should point out that the validity of that theory really has nothing to do with evolution. As for proof of it, we have the expanding universe around us, and the theory also predicts the same levels of cosmic background radiation that we actually see everywhere. Could there be other explanations? Possibly. But the Big Bang is still the best we've got.
fact_453	fact	I dunno about that, but possibly. They do know that those afflicted with ADD have some unusual structures in their brains too. Last I heard they were investigating the causality of homosexuality with developmental deficencies in the brain. The jury is not out yet
fact_1962	fact	"Among the icons (idols) of modern mysticism there is one that reigns supreme. It is the myth of evolution. We scoff at the gods of the anchient pagans as if we were untouched by their superstition and yet we mystify our science with the likes of Darwin, the high priest of natural selection. Darwin taught a fable that started in a warm little pond and through a process that has became known as gradualism (minute changes over eons) all life arose out of a primordial soup.   Life is not chaotic it is orderly and requires replication. Without this you just have a lot of chemicals mixing in an infinite variety. The reason that life must be derived from life (biogenesis) in the minds of most is that this is the only way we have ever seen it happen. ""You can imagine anything you like but you can only understand the truth"" as Newton said. Now if amino acids are the mirror image of nucleic acid sugars and this in true of all living things then we are limited to this as fundamental to life. This in my opinion is the fundamental first step and it cannot happen peicemeal, it all has to happen all at once.  One more thing, evolution is a biogenesis theory and actual evidence for abiogenesis is rare and fragmentary just as it is for every other aspect of the single common ancestor model."
fact_335	fact	"Fascinating - you blew right through your own usual misunderstandings of Darwinism and Darwinists and ended up with a sentence that is actually meaningful.   HGT (along with genetic drift) are important parts of modern evolutionary theory, but they do indeed have nothing to do with darwinian evolution sensu stricto, which does indeed insist on natural selection. This is why evolutionary biologists object to being called Darwinists in the sense that you and WW usually try to impose on us, and it is why we insist that there is more to evolution than natural selection or RM&NS alone, and it is why we talk about the Neodarwinian Synthesis and Modern Evolutionary Theory. HGT validates the modern ToE. Modern evolutionary theory incorporates Darwin's version, and lot's more. HGT is part of the ""lots more"".   Some versions of lateral gene transfer have been accepted and studied for many decades, notably versions of conjugation in bacteria. (It wasn't until biologists were able to start sequencing DNA in quantity that we were able to see all the retroviral DNA segments and so forth.)  When someone like Gould (for example) talks about Darwinian evolution, depending on context, they are talking about either 1) the historical early version of the ToE as Darwin envisaged it, 2) the position that natural selection is the dominant process in evolution, or 3) an instance of evolutionary change in which natural selection is inferred to have been by far the most significant process. Evolution has moved well beyond Darwin's initial ideas to include mutations, recombination, and genetic drift, including HGT, in all sorts of combinations with each other and with natural selection.  As Chemist says, once HGT has occurred, the new version with the new genes can easily find itself competing with the old version, providing another way that NS can be involved, but it doesn't have to be. NS is just not all there is to evolution.  I can't wait to see how you are going to misinterpret this next."
fact_1037	fact	Flooding is more a immediate problem.
fact_2258	fact	Actually, it's true. One Darwin's basic ideas upon which he based the theory of natural selection.
fact_1989	fact	No but the fact that infants have brain activity makes them a world of difference between a zygote that has no brain activity. They can think and feel and exhibit all the characteristics of other human beings. A zygote exhibits none of those characteristics.
fact_1751	fact	Sounds anti-government to me. Are you against your President's economic policies, the fed, bureacracy and tee poor public education?  Sounds probably who SEIU should have directed their gall toward and not a man's personal property and family...with the police help of course and purloined school busses. Do the taxpayers owe the SEIU anything? Nope but the SEIU according to CNN owes more than 90 million along with 4 million in interest. Perhaps if they paid their bills they wouldn't add to the public debt by using government property to protest government policy?  You wrote it but didn't understand what you wrote...darn public schools emoticonXGood
fact_1745	fact	"Doesn't count. Took place in a ""gun free zone"". By law no guns are allowed there, so by law this incident couldn't take place."
fact_1023	fact	A lot of work has been done on that topic. I would recommend reading Debating Design from Darwin to DNA It is a monster of a book, but it is definitely worth the read.
fact_484	fact	  Actually it would be impossible for the monblock to spin. There is NO PLACE OUTSIDE OF IT from which to observe! Any observer would necessarily be inside the budding universe - no place else to go you see. Indeed its still impossible for us to know whether the universe as a whole is spinning or not!!!! Sorry I was being a bit ironic thinking you would see the point. Guess not though.
fact_2264	fact	"First off, not all pro-choice advocates support this position. Second, How does a sonogram help to make an informed choice? What does a sonogram actually inform a pregnant woman about...that she is pregnant? I would think that if she was going to get a sonogram, that she would know that she is already pregnant. Seems like simple logic to me.   By saying it would help them make a better choice, don't you really mean to say that it might influence them to not have an abortion, which is actually your choice for them? You seem to be counting on the puppy store effect. You can drive by the puppy store every day without giving a thought to buying a puppy. But if you actually stop and look at one, you might just feel sorry for the pathetic little puppy couped up in the little cage, and decide to buy it just to ""rescue"" it from it's plight. It goes something like this:  ""awww...look at the cute little puppy, we can't leave it here, we just have to take it home"".   4 months later, that same cute little puppy is sitting in an SPCA shelter waiting to either be adopted or destroyed. All because it's do-gooder owner made the decision to buy it based on emotion rather than informed choice."
fact_2270	fact	That is one definition of creation. There are many. You again make a mistake of making an assumption about what you want to argue about, and argue against that.  If you want a (non-exhaustive list) see  http://www.crystalinks.com/creation.html  You have simply picked one model, treated it as the only one, and constructed a (thus false) argument against it.
fact_490	fact	Again, they must be alive. Previously, you submitted that there are many problems with society and life or whatever. Could it be that some people might be able to survive those problems? Could it be that those survivors would be the ones to reproduce?
fact_1779	fact	Elephant/Hippo. 'Nuff said.
fact_2099	fact	So, I guess you didn't get the memo that this country was FOUNDED on Christian/Judaic beliefs. Remember: You do have rights; to an extent.
fact_679	fact	And we do. In some phyla, most of the partially-formed examples still exist. You can find them in mollusks, for example.      http://www.pnas.org/content/vol104/suppl_1/images/large/zpq0120756920001.jpeg
fact_1590	fact	OK.
fact_1584	fact	Of course they didn't see it walk, it's a different genus altogether.
fact_645	fact	Well if you're going to quote that article that mentions Canada to support your opinion, then does that mean you're in favor of gun registration and licensing? Canada has them. And if the NRA is really interested in enforcing laws why do they ask congress to reduce the budget of law enforcement? The NRA uses its political muscle to make it easier for criminals to obtain guns. Robert Ricker, former top lawyer of the NRA, talks about it.
fact_123	fact	In this case I'm afraid it does.   (1) To see if the OJ scene would once again playout.   (2) To see a ruling made on behalf of an unborn child.      All the rest is one dumb killer, IMO.
fact_137	fact	There's more to the adoption of an atheistic stance than just rejecting the bible because it's scientifically false. 'The bible is scientific nonsense, therefore there is no god' is not a logical stance.  Modern-day citizens are far more likely to be aware of the sheer range of religious views in human cultures, past and present, and the consequent improbability that just one of them (and hey, waddaya know? It's mine!) is wholly true and all the others wholly false. This leads some into woolly New-Age-ist pick-and-mixing; others to conclude that the world's religions are all the product of a similar, purely mundane, process of cultural evolution, and that none actually reflects fundamental truths.
fact_651	fact	Yep, it certainly cann be quite expensive.
fact_889	fact	False. Random mutation and natural selection have been observed in the lab using bacteria; in some cases the researchers even determined exactly which mutations in the genomes produced the advantageous changes.
fact_1553	fact	Can you show me the stats for this, are we dealing with 2003/4 numbers compared to before the ban, or the year after? Biggest problem we have with guns is actually modified starting pistols rather than smuggled guns, our gangs not quite measure up to yours, despite what many of them would like to think ;)
fact_862	fact	"The whole ""change the definition of marriage"" is mainly a scare tactic used by anti-gay religious bigots. They don't seem to realize that words can have several meanings."
fact_1235	fact	Correct. The National Guard is nothing more than an 'extension' of the Federal Army (and Air Force). We wear the same uniform as our active duty counterparts as well.  You may recall that back in the 60's Gov. George Wallace was powerless to stop the 'Federalization' of National Guard troops which were used against him, by forcing the desegregation of Alabama schools. Regardless of where you stand on the politics of that situation, the Federal government clearly overstepped their authority here and thus established their control over 'National Guard' units henceforth.  The National Guard being referred to as the 'militia' is laughable and wholly inaccurate. It's a cop out used by anti-gunners to excuse their attempts to disarm the 'law abiding'.
fact_1221	fact	A slimey claim you cannot support as usual. In developed Nations, the U.S. is far down the list as has been posted on this very board at least 5 times. Those 'other' Nations also have far more crime and violent crime than the U.S.
fact_1547	fact	Look again, Smith. All those killed in these places, died in a location where they were told they couldn't have a gun with them. More guns weren't a part of the equation, less guns were. There were no guns in these locations except for those illegally brought in by the killers, and those of the police who arrived after it was already too late.  Fewer guns aren't the answer, anybody with a dab of common sense would realize that because it's impossible to disarm the bad guys.
fact_876	fact	And if wishes were horses...  You've no evidence, AA. None at all. Nothing in the natural world disputes the great age of the earth. Don't you find that in the least bit remarkable, if it really is a few thousand years old? Wouldn't something fail to jibe? Read my challenge in the debate section: why doesn't our earth look like the one in my thought experiment?
fact_2066	fact	"What we have here is simply a perspective problem, which is the problem with most debates. I see the Bible as sound, and every ""error"" in the Bible I have researched (I have admittedly not researched them all) have been refuted."
fact_686	fact	Yes, but I think you missed my point. I stated this above, remember the prohabition? People actually drank MORE alchohal. Without a ban, law abiding citizens and criminals will have them, with a ban, there will be just criminals.
fact_1209	fact	Because our laws say it is a right...
fact_692	fact	My point was that just because an animal has features that resemble different animals doesn't mean it has evolved from them.
fact_2072	fact	Actually, the process of fossilisation is not slow and can be done relatively quickly. All what you need is for sediments to quickly cover a dead (or an alive body - as what would have happened to Noah's Flood) and hence, fossilsation can occur rapidly; evolutionarly speaking, fossils take millions of years to fossilise a bone, but unless the bone is covered by sediments quickly, the bone will never fossilise.
fact_684	fact	"Actually, the bird is fully feathered. The feathers offer insulation and of course, when impregnated with oil, buoyancy. Where did you get your information? Well, no matter. You bought it hook, line and sinker. Did it occur to you that you should possibly check your ""facts""?"
fact_2064	fact	"As I said earlier, it is garbage. He can't back it up. As a scientist-in-training, you know that real science requires research and evidential support. supersport has neither. The ""support"" that he cites -- when read in their entirety -- do little or nothing to actually support him. On one forum (mentioned earlier on this forum), the author of the scientific paper that supersport cited actually joined the board to tell supersport to stop misrepresenting his research.  The only ""agenda"" that the scientific community has is to find the truth. The fact that the scientific community trounces supersport's points nonstop is not what makes his points wrong; his points are wrong on their own merit, and they'd be wrong regardless of anybody's refutations of them."
fact_2070	fact	Power out. That was a link to the American Museum of Natural History in New York. Go back and look later if you want.
fact_690	fact	"You seem to have trouble creating working links. Here is a corrected link to your quote.   Darwin, Charles. On the Origin of Species - 6th Edition. Chapter 1 - Variation Under Domestication.  Do a find on, ""Hence it must be assumed"" to see the quote in context.  Your intent might be misinterpreted by some who have not read ""Origin"" and are unfamiliar with Darwin thoughts. To the uninformed, your claim about what Darwin said could easily be misinterpreted to mean that even accidental changes to the environment by man that cause evolutionary change in populations is ""artificial selection."" Of course, you couldn't have meant that, since that is clearly not what Darwin was talking about. The context of the quote that you cite makes that clear. The whole context of the quote is in the chapter on Variation Under Domestication. Darwin does not discuss accidental changes to the environment in that chapter. That certainly would be more confusing than profitable in a chapter in which Darwin was attempting to explain the basics of his theory with examples from domestic animals, especially pigeons. It is abundantly clear that Darwin was referring to the selection by man of breeding stock since he remarks that in the domestication of a species man ""...intentionally or by chance picked out..."" characteristics. Of course, by use of the word ""chance"", Darwin meant characteristics that existed in the individuals of the breeding stock that were selected for other reasons, i.e., intentionally."
fact_848	fact	And that is why they are wrong. They don't understand science. Science is not the presentation of proof but explanations of the evidence that have been tested.
fact_1579	fact	Say that again? Mayor Nagin was the one who gave the order for all weapons to be seized, Bush had absolutely nothing to do with it. President Bush even signed into federal law the bill that would prevent such an occurrence from ever happening again, by making it a crime for any government organization to seize firearms during a declared state of emergency.  Try again, Simone.
fact_1237	fact	You don't have to be the best organism to survive. You just have to be good ENOUGH.
fact_2058	fact	Nah, it is a gateway in the fact that herion addicts and crack addicts are in the same room and are the same friends of yours that supply the marijuana. Would legalization help this? I dunno, but probably cause many other problems without everyone legalizing it.
fact_860	fact	And yet the post-Dunblane handgun ban happened after only one event.
fact_1551	fact	"The statement was made in an address to the Pontifical Acacemy of Sciences in 1996. It is clear that the Pope considers the theory of evolution to be valid. However, this is not a an encyclical and not a statement ex cathedra. Therefore it is not a statement of doctrine of the Roman Catholic Church. However, he is stating that, recognizing a restriction, the theory of evolution does not contradict Christian faith. He reaffirmed the statement made by Pius XII of that restriction. They is, ""If the human body take its origin from pre-existent living matter, the spiritual soul is immediately created by God.""  So yes. Catholics may be theistic evolutionists, evolutionary creationists or ID creationists. I suppose they can even fit into the other categories. I have known some YEC Catholics."
fact_874	fact	Manslaughter involves a direct action that causes an unintentional death. Miscarriage is involuntary; besides the person suffering a miscarriage might well want to keep the baby. To equate miscarriage with manslaughter is preposterous.
fact_1545	fact	Actually, it is quite correct. You misunderstand. The text book was trying to make it simple so that you would understand. The text book wasn't simple enough. The first record of carbonaria was in 1848. The discussion you quote was trying to explain quite simply, so that you might understand why the change took place. There is no record of anyone ever seeing a carbonaria before 1848. It is probably a safe assumption that an occasional mutation caused some to be born from time to time, but they were not able to reproduce to the extent that they were ever noted before 1848.
fact_1223	fact	So you agree that we should leave weather out of it and focus on healt care cost?  All the developed countries (all of Europe, Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan, Israel) have universal healthcare. Their COST per capita is about half of ours. They have better outcomes i.e. longer life expectancy, fewer preventable deaths, lower infant mortality, in most cases more doctors per capita. They have lower cost in spite of the fact that the U.S. insurance companies insure only the healthy. Over there they treat the sick. What are the insuranc ecompanies doing with our money?? How come the small businesses, the self-emplyed are priced out of the market and left to die in pain??
fact_121	fact	"""Usually, ""rationality"" is a Humpty-Dumpty word, that means whatever the user finds is convenient to club his opponents with.""  http://world.std.com/~mhuben/skept/rationality.html  Knowledge itself is a limited commodity. To make a claim that everything is knowable is a statement that is impossible to prove; Scientism makes this claim. Closely related to it is Objectivism.

fact_647	fact	So you made the point on the interpretation of a legal document. The point is it is okay to illegalise abortion regardless of the reasons for doing so. Thinking outside of our current example can you not see the glaring problem with such an approach? I hope you can because the consequences of accepting such a philosophy are dire indeed.  However, returning to our original point, that being the former part of the proposed Bill's title I'd like some supporting evidence. I have pointed out the issue's with Steeeeve's citation, so hope you have something else to offer.
fact_653	fact	So why is it in the debates your position is easily viewed as opposed to firearm rights?
fact_135	fact	Good old monkeys! What can't we learn from them :)  Since we are in the Creation vs Evolution section I'm guessing that your debate here is that monkeys and humans show some similar ways of thinking such as in this experiment. It does seem like further evidence that evolution did take place between our two species although it isn't a case cracker by any means.
fact_1592	fact	Actually that passage does not define a marriage.   It just says that a man shouldn't divorce his wife.  It does say that in the beginning god made man and woman.  You can infer whatever you wish about that, but it doesn't explicitly say anything about a marriage being strictly between a man and a woman.  Besides, if current laws were actually rooted in the Bible, in this passage, then divorce would be illegal. But our laws are NOT rooted in the Bible, so the passage is irrelevant.   I realize you were addressing a different point but I just had to respond.  Here is the whole context though:

fact_109	fact	Typical YEC misrepresentation. Professor Olsen has no qualms with the concept of evolution- what he does not see is the link between birds and certain theropods. If you think he does not think evolution is correct I suggest you send him an email asking for his views. Here is his address:  olsons@si.edu  Off course, you might be trying to infer that because their are differences of opinion in the field of evolution makes the whole notion irrelevant. I disagree, but if you insist we will examine differences in opinion between different groups within, lets see......... how about Christianity? Do they make the whole religion completely rejectable?
fact_2266	fact	New York mayor Bloomberg broke the law by sending undercover agents on sting operations outside of his state of jurisdiction to get the evidence necessary to sue 19 out of state licensed firearms dealers.

Or are you going to take the chicken way out and claim that a public official must be allowed to break the law to address crime in his territory?
fact_486	fact	I don't know anyone on the committees, but people I know who have taken a look at the initial proposal and understand the current Oregon public health program (manages Medicaid and other fed/state health funds) say it's financially feasible by the proposal to combine current private policy subscriptions (including civil service at all levels other than federal) and fed/state/muni contributions. I'm told the key will be deductibles and how they scale them.  Oregon's schools (excluding rural designations) would have plenty of money if educator unions didn't have funding in a stranglehold. Word is that unless benefits and retirement now equaling private sector CEO levels aren't cut back the system will crash within the next decade.   Off-topic, but civil service pay and benefits are an upcoming US crisis. Unions have switched from ruining manufacturing industries to the public sector. The county I live in already has a dual work force, union and non-union, with union workers to eventually disappear by attrition. Maybe sooner when looking at budget forecasting.

fact_1747	fact	The reason carbon dating is not being used on the remains is that even the most advanced C14 dating methods can only - even in principle - report a date within the last 60,000 years or so.

The fossils in question have been dated via numerous other methods, all of which are in agreement - what the heck is the point of performing another test which you know will yield a 'young' result even if the fossil is old? What could such a test possibly tell us?  Apart from the 'horizontally instead of vertically' part which I didn't understand -

fact_323	fact	Hello Aivlis, my name is Joe. Please let me tell you a little about my self. When I was twenty one I started dating my first girlfriend. She was seven years older then me. She had a seven year old little girl. I was working three jobs when we meet (one full time, two part time). Within six months she was pregnant (Yes we were stupid and did not use protection). I went out a bought a ring and proposed to her. She said yes. A short time later she told me she was going to get an abortion. I was devastated. I told her I would open a bank account in her name and have the pay from two of my jobs direct deposited into the account. I told her I would be there for her and our child. She still wanted to get an abortion. I told her I would raise the baby myself and that she would have no obligation, she still wanted to get an abortion. I told her I could not support her in this decision. The night before she went for the abortion, I begged her to reconsider. She would not. I wept like a baby because of this. I took me many years and the mercy and grace of God to heal from this life changing event. If there is anything I can say or do to get you to reconsider this please let me know. There are many people who would love to help you either keep your unborn child or find a safe loving home for him/her. My wife and I have a fifteen month old daughter, her name is Halley Raine. She is a real blessing, but she will never take the place of the child I would have had with my ex girlfriend. My other child would be about ten or eleven now. Please let me know if I can be of any help to you. What ever road you do decide to go down, I will be keeping you in my prayers.
fact_337	fact	"Well, evolution says that everything evolved over ""millions of years"", correct? Let's say it takes a certain species 1 million years to evolve. That means that every 100 years of its ""evolving process"" we should be able to see 1,000 mutations! In the last 100 years, what SPECIES have we seen evolve 1,000 times? (Into an entirely new species, no less.)"

fact_451	fact	Would make, that is. However, not all members of the population are able to breed.  Should we make this a thread for posting examples of natural selection? That might be fun.  An example: rats are often a problem. The solution? Introduce rat poison.  Unfortunately, some rats are immune to the poison. You should have guessed it- those rats reproduce, and the others don't (as much).  Another: elephants use their tusks on predators and for ritual purposes (attracting mates). Some elephants lack tusks or have shorter tusks.  However, when poachers kill the elephants with the biggest tusks, the elephants with smaller tusks (or no tusks) reproduce more.
fact_2299	fact	Certainly... just like how the makers of Expelled have repeatedly refused to publish the interviews in full. It's not just that PZ and Dawkins object to the content of the movie -- the makers of Expelled don't want them to be able to object in the first place. It's always been their favorite argument against PZ to dangle over the head of his criticisms the fact that he hasn't even seen the movie. They can't pull that one on Dawkins anymore, which is to their disadvantage, but fortunately they managed to spot PZ before it was too late.
fact_1948	fact	Yep life is sometimes incredibly fine tuned. Create and maintain an oddball environment and some existing species will move in or if there is no existing species which can use the environment something may well eventually evolve to do so. Microbes are incredibly efficient at this because of their short generation times. So are things like nematodes etc.

If you care to give an example of a country where constitutionally protected firearm ownership was violated by confiscation, we could discuss it.  Safe storage does present enforcement problems but that isn't reason enough to abandon the idea. Thefts and accidents will be enough to call attention to violators, although you guys generally do not want to have to report thefts. Why's that?  What identification is the buyer required to furnish for a NCIS check?
fact_280	fact	From wiki: During the Italian Campaign of 1943 and 1944, 100,000 Free French soldiers fought on the Allied side, notably in the fighting on the Winter Line and Gustav Line. By the time of the Normandy Invasion, the Free French forces numbered more than 400,000 strong. 900 Free French paratroopers landed as part of the in the British Special Air Service Brigade (S.A.S.); the Free French 2nd Armoured Division, under General Leclerc, landed at Utah Beach in Normandy on 1 August 1944, and eventually led the drive towards Paris, while the divisions which had been fighting in Italy became part of the French First Army, under General Jean de Lattre de Tassigny, and joined the U.S. 7th Army in Operation Dragoon. This operation was the Allied invasion of southern France. The Allied forces advanced up the line of the RhÃ´ne River to liberate the Vosges and southern Alsace.  Are we good so far?  Again from wiki: The French Resistance played a valuable role in facilitating the Allies' rapid advance through France following the invasion of Normandy on June 6, 1944, and Provence on August 15, by providing military intelligence on the Atlantic Wall and Wehrmacht deployments and coordinating acts of sabotage on power, transport and telecommunications networks.

fact_1141	fact	I linked to a post that sufficiently validates my point. If you want to discuss in more detail the broader implications of current abortion policy, I would be happy to do so.  We can start with your suggestion that abortions are illegal after the first trimester. That suggestion, while common, is not correct. 12% of abortions in the United States occur after the first trimester of pregnancy. That's an estimated total of about 154,800 abortions in 2002.  And besides that, you miss the point. The point I tried to advance is that people who are avidly pro-choice typically do not see any circumstances under which they would restrict abortions save for (in some instances) the third trimester. Thus, they would defend a woman's decision to obtain an abortion for the sole reason that she fears that the child will be one gender rather than the other.  It also would be interesting to know (since you felt the need to weight in) whether you support abortions performed solely for the purpose of gender selection?
fact_1155	fact	Most of the time one should be able to tell the sex of the baby by about 20 weeks and very often even at sixteen. Second trimester starts at 12 weeks. You canât get an abortion after determining the sex because its illegal.  Where are you getting your data?
fact_1633	fact	would this be considered intelligent design? to me it would be like winding up a top, loading it with paint, and then letting it spin on paper to create a painting. the process is deliberately set in motion, but the painting itself is random and not deliberate. where the paint falls is not by design, even though the overall pattern would be.  anyway, to answer the question, there are lots of people who believe in a creator as well as evlution, so the beliefs are not mutually exclusive. the problem is that christianity depends upon the account of genesis being true. spontaneous origin is mutually exclusive to genesis, but evolution by itself is not necessarily. but evolution poses other problems such as the age of the earth and the existence of dinosaurs that creationists are stumped by.  in order to belief in evolution, you must, at the very least, disregard the genesis account. and disregarding genesis automatically invalidates christianity. but it doesnt necessarily invalidate the existence of a creator. pretty wierd, huh?
fact_531	fact	all you have to do is scroll back a page or two in this forum...look for my posts regarding cichlids, guppies and lizards. I also gave you snails. show me any example of so-called natural selection or evolution in the field and I bet I can shoot it down.
fact_1800	fact	Actually, none of those are predictions that creationism makes, and what's more, they're all disprovable. Biochemists estimate we're within ten years of creating life from non life. Prepared to chew on that foot?  The logical leap you're making here is that if we assume creationism is true, evolution and abiogenesis must be false, and that's silly. It's actually possible for all three to be true. God could have the ability to create life, but perhaps God never did so and allowed life to arise through natural processes. Moreover, suppose God created the first life and allowed it to evolve from that. None of these possibilities are inherently contradictory to anything but a specific reading of a specific holy book.
fact_257	fact	A broken-down tv set is not a valid parallel. It doesn't reproduce, and there is only one of it. Life, on the other hand, does reproduce (at least some organisms do).  It would be interesting for someone to make a counter displaying the number of times natural selection needs to be explained to creationists.  Actually, that would be easy: infinity. They just don't get it.
fact_243	fact	The amount of atmospheric greenhouse gases (CO2 is not the only greenhouse gas) threatens to snowball because of the rapid depletion of available carbon sinks and the consumption of existing ones. The MAIN problem with de-forestations is NOT that the trees are no longer removing CO2 from the atmosphere, but our use of them is adding CO2 to it (burning, etc.) and the other sources we could turn to to remove it are also being used up. Methane hydrates in the polar seabeds threaten to rapidly increase the amount of atmospheric greenhouse gases as soon as the temperature increases enough to destablize the ice crystals holding them in place.

fact_1425	fact	As pointed out, with a different physics, chemistry and biology, the universe as we know it wouldn't exist. What is really damaging to the concept of creationism as truth is a list of what we should expect if a flood had occurred under the same laws of science that are in operation today. One problem with creationism (I know, you want to ignore the problems) is that they constantly fall back on miracle in order to do a reset of reality in order to circumvent reality when creationism bumps into scientifically impossible events.  I don't mean to rain on the parade, but with all that said, it has been done. There is a list of 28 items, originally compiled by Jim Moore, that we should find if the flood happened as per the Bible. Not even miracles can solve these. That list is followed by further problems that have been compiled by Ken Harding from numerous sources.  What Would We Expect to Find if the World Had Flooded  For more information you can refer to the Flood Geology FAQs at TO. Two items with information that specifically addresses the question of the OP are Problems with a Global Flood, and The Geologic Column and its Implications for the Flood .
fact_914	fact	so whats your belief of how life/the universe began lurch? (if any)
fact_1431	fact	The reality is this is no different the following link: ie...the animals who were fed one diet passed on traits differently than those who were fed another diet. Traits, according to evolutionists arise RANOCMLY. Get that, geniuses? RANDOMLY. This is not random. Structural damage in this case did not happen randomly....nor did the dengenerative effects to the fur, nervous systems, bones, allergies, and mental processes. Instead this was all dictated by the environment. Thus, despite the emergence of new traits in the milk/cooked food-fed diet of the one population, it had nothing to do with darwinian random mutation or natural selection. This is a hole. A huge hole....it's environmental evolution...that is, animals simply changing with a changing environment. Lamarckism predicts that the environment changes first, followed up by new traits. Neo-darwinists say that new traits arise before and/or unoriented to the environment, only to be then be selected.  I win.  And this is no different than the following:  http://www.the-scientist.com/2004/7/5/14/1/   Normally, the fur of agouti mice is yellow, brown, or a calico-like mixture of the two, depending on the number of attached methyl groups. But when Duke University researchers Jirtle and Waterland fed folic acid and other methyl-rich supplements to pregnant mothers, despite the fact that all offspring inherited exactly the same agouti gene (i.e., with no nucleotide differences), mice who received supplements had offspring with mostly brown fur, whereas mice without supplements gave birth to mostly yellow pups with a higher susceptibility to obesity, diabetes, and cancer.  LAMARCKJean-Baptiste Lamarck (1744â1829)  The environmental ability of epigenetic inheritance may not necessarily bring to mind Lamarckian images of giraffes stretching their necks to reach the treetops (and then giving birth to progeny with similarly stretched necks), but it does give researchers reason to reconsider long-refuted notions about the inheritance of acquired characteristics. Eighteenth-century French naturalist Jean Baptiste de Lamarck proposed that environmental cues could cause phenotypic changes transmittable to offspring.   Checkmate, losers.  Oh, and by the way, electro-loser.....it doesn't matter if this diet experiment can be extrapolated to humans or not. (Of course I realize you are just spouting your mouth off just to hear your head rattle)...the reality is, though, these cats evolved new traits by way of non-darwinian mechanisms. So did the mice in both experiments and so did the pigs. Are you truly trying to tell me that cats and mice and pigs evolve by way of the inheritance of acquired characteristics but humans don't?

fact_1381	fact	"Start with the largest most powerful calibur you can get and physically handle. Then consider:  Practice = lots of ammo.   Lots of ammo = cost increase with larger calibur.  Practice = responsible gun owner.  Training = responsible gun owner.  Large calibur = ability to stop the attack quickly.  Small calibur = less likely to exit your target and hit someone behind it.  Well placed shots from a small calibur are superior to a large calibur that missed.  As a bare minium take a training course that teaches you to handle low light conditions and drawing from a concealed holster. When you need it most are under conditions most favored by criminals, e.g. from behind, up close, in the dark, with suprise, or any combinations of them.  A good instructor will also inform you of all the legal implications of having to defend yourself, the implications of comming to the aid of other people, the legal implications of defense on public and private property, etc.  Personally I have made the decision that I WILL NOT help anyone in mortal danger whom I do not know. The legal implications if you are wrong are very drastic. You can never know the complete conditions of strangers and how they got to be in mortal danger, for all you know the person who just pulled out a gun may be an undercover cop. Thus I will only come to the aid for friends and family whom I know and thier business. My personal decision.  The guys at the gun store are interested with selling you a pistol with the highest profit margin. Not the best tool for you. Only way to find out is with trigger time and carry time on the pistol. So you may have to horse trade a few times until you find the right one.  My personal opinion? A very small .38 revolver with more than one holster. Sometimes you need to carry it on your ankle, sometimes in your pocket, or sometimes on your hip. Plus a ton of ammo for practice. The ammo you spend on practice can soon cost more than the pistol.  Los of inexpensive, reliable, and well built .38's. Not a lot of fun to shoot, but hey, this is a tool with a very specific purpose. Of course of you can deal with more, by all means upgrade to more. Your not going to place a sniper shot between the eyes of a felon. Most likely you will need it at night, very quickly, and at a little longer than ""knife fighting distances"".  I use a .45 auto. I shoot a full size .45 for fun. Train with the full size .45, but I carry a compact .45. The compact has exactly the same shape in my hand as the large .45, thus when I have to go the the small .45 quickly, it will retain the same operation and configuration in my hand as the large .45. The large .45 has more fun factor, not a lot of fun to carry a big piece of steel on your hip all day.  Plus I reload the .45 empties. The cost of a large calibur with reloading becomes as much as a smaller calibur when the ammo is store bought. The time spent reloading keeps me out of bars on week nights and my girlfriend more comforted.  By the end of the day, after carrying even the compact .45. I wish I had a small .38. The most effecient solution I have seen was a friend who both had a .357 magnum and .22 of the same pistol. He practiced with the .22 pistol all he wanted and very cheaply. Shot the .357 magnum just enough to practice with the recoil. The .22 and .357 had exactly the same size, shape, and trigger pull.  My $.02"

I invite anyone to post any of Darwin's arguments that specifically outline his case against design because of ""bad"" design.   That said, consider this, your car is said to operate at 25% fuel efficiency. One could claim then the car is 75% bad design, therefore it is not designed, and if it is, certainly not by anyone of any intelligence.  Your audio CD's have Reed-Solomon error correction because the read/write process is full of errors that need correcting. Cleary this is ""bad design"" that engineers would create read/write heads that make so many errors in the first place. Same with modems and host of other devices. Clearly if in the remote chance these bad designs are evidence of design, the designers must be clueless!  Poorly designed dramas have villains and heroes. Clearly a drama (even a divine drama) is poorly designed if it has villains in the story. All the characters should be Pollyanna and there should be no great tragedies on the road to a happy ending. Life and the Divine drama, like CD's and cars, are clearly not designed, or at least not designed by anyone with intelligence, because of all the bad design woven into the designs.  The reason audio CD's have so many read/write errors which are corrected Reed-Solomon error correction (somewhat like us reading someone's writing and mentally correcting spelling and grammar errors) is that it is the most optimal way to get as much data on a CD as possible. The tightest packing of data implies the highest amount of errors based on the Shannon capacity theorem.  The Mp3's and JPEGS are even more ""error"" prone in that they are inexact representations of the original sound or picture, but the goal was not fidelity but compactness.  A similar consideration is for the 75% inefficiency for cars. The goal is for higher acceleration and agility and cost, etc., not fuel efficiency.   The point is ""bad"" design, in the grand scheme of things, might not be bad design after all.   The high rate of sickness and death, the eventual death of the universe as predicted by the 2nd law of thermodynamics are not evidences that the Designer is unwise, any more than the many errors in the read/write process of audio CD suggests the engineers of those devices are incompetent.  Origin of Species Chapter 13:  There is another and equally curious branch of the present subject; namely, the comparison not of the same part in different members of a class, but of the different parts or organs in the same individual. Most physiologists believe that the bones of the skull are homologous with that is correspond in number and in relative connexion with the elemental parts of a certain number of vertebrae. The anterior and posterior limbs in each member of the vertebrate and articulate classes are plainly homologous. We see the same law in comparing the wonderfully complex jaws and legs in crustaceans. It is familiar to almost every one, that in a flower the relative position of the sepals, petals, stamens, and pistils, as well as their intimate structure, are intelligible in the view that they consist of metamorphosed leaves, arranged in a spire. In monstrous plants, we often get direct evidence of the possibility of one organ being transformed into another; and we can actually see in embryonic crustaceans and in many other animals, and in flowers, that organs which when mature become extremely different, are at an early stage of growth exactly alike.   How inexplicable are these facts on the ordinary view of creation! Why should the brain be enclosed in a box composed of such numerous and such extraordinarily shaped pieces of bone? As Owen has remarked, the benefit derived from the yielding of the separate pieces in the act of parturition of mammals, will by no means explain the same construction in the skulls of birds. Why should similar bones have been created in the formation of the wing and leg of a bat, used as they are for such totally different purposes? Why should one crustacean, which has an extremely complex mouth formed of many parts, consequently always have fewer legs; or conversely, those with many legs have simpler mouths? Why should the sepals, petals, stamens, and pistils in any individual flower, though fitted for such widely different purposes, be all constructed on the same pattern ?   On the theory of natural selection, we can satisfactorily answer these questions.  Homology was a pre-darwinian idea with the term coined by Owen who rather despised Darwin and his ideas.  Darwin tries to argue why a Designer would not use the same for the same function. He says homology is evidence of an unwise design. The premise is a Creator wouldn't be so inefficient.  But, unless one has a handle on the teleological goal, one is free to fabricate all manner of ""bad design"" arguments (for example read/write errors in audio CD's or fuel inefficient cars).   The Biotic Message Theory suggest the teleological goal for biotic reality is to communicate to humans that there is one Designer and author of life, and that life could not have evolved. Like a great novel, the ""imperfections"" of biology are part of a larger plot.  It is turning out, Darwin's argument from homology is a concept in crisis."
fact_1342	fact	But those are only the book sthat were taken into the big collection. What about the other ones? Or did I not read all there is to read on that site?   One of the apocryphical texts may very well be written by Thomas, the apostle Thomas. None of the writers of the four well known Gospels were apostles, right? They were writers, heard the story quite a few years after and do not agree on all that much actually. There are definitely four different stories on how he was crucified for instance.

Whether there is much difference between now and a couple of years ago...dont know.
fact_2111	fact	Actually, we didn't. The first record of a melanic form was in 1848. Presumably other melanic individuals had appeared before this, both in Biston bebularia as well as other moths. We know that a similar mutation occucrred in other moths North America some years after the 1848 record of the B. betualria.  There are actually several alleles of the gene responsible for color that form a dominence hierarchy with the fully black morph (called carbonaria) as the top dominant and the typical as recessive. The intermediate forms are referred to as insularia. They are uncommon. At any rate, by 1895, 98% of observed B. betularia in industrialized areas were carbonaria.
fact_929	fact	I think he meant a sycophant.
fact_1418	fact	And why is that? Because the framers of our constitution felt that all white men were equal, the rest were property. It is this kind of ignorant and narrow minded thought that will have people rubbing their heads in 200 years, wondering why gays were ever treated as second class citizens who did not deserve the same rights given to straights.
fact_1197	fact	Yes the facts speak for themselves, they just don't sing the song you think they do. No biologist will find any need at all to wave any hands in this instance, for as you say the facts DO speak for themselves.
fact_1829	fact	"But you are using the word theory incorrectly. Since part of your discussion purports to be about science, one might make the mistake that you are using the word ""theory"" with a scientific connotation. You are not. What you are talking about is folk mythology, not theory."

fact_1183	fact	"Bad, bad, bad. :(   1) Reducing meat consumption will create a change towards more agricultural farming which is more sustainable for humans and the environment.  1) Some, perhaps all ""Livestock feed"" is actually edible for humans; GM maize is regularly consumed in the US and Mexico.  2) One does not have to consume those foods as there are thousands of plant foods that can be eaten."

fact_1815	fact	Way to miss the entire point, Clerisian.   My point was that is it a horrible experience for many women, and that I wish we could strive towards a society where abortions were no longer needed. Wishful thinking by a midtwenties female who just went through the most horrifying experience of her life, forgive me if I didn't clarify well enough.  I can't imagine that anyone would disagree with that.
fact_524	fact	Actually there is, RU-486 (AKA Mifepristone), which aborts upt to two months into the pregnancy.      But again, this poster sems to be talking about Plan B, which is NOT an abortion pill, and was what was allowed in the military.

fact_1632	fact	"http://www.answersingenesis.org/home/Area/isd/jones.asp  When Judge John Jones of Dover Pa. was considering evidence from persuasive evolutionists concerning what should be taught in schools, could it be that he ""hardly knew the field, and didn't have an answer"" that would fit the time constraints of his decision making? Did judge John Jones know what was going on in this country 100 years ago?   Why can't today's ID opposing evolutionists see the mistake religious people made 100 years ago, and be enlightened enough to be more open minded about trying to suppress ideas? Maybe because human nature doesn't improve over the generations - following the money always comes first."
fact_1626	fact	"The points individually have already been answered but actually you will find out that there is no complete proof for anything. No one can really tell you a definite answer to these questions.  No one can be completely sure what happened, but at least Evolution gives more information and ""proof"" that makes sense.  How could you prove me that your opinions are right? Can you prove me that the Bible is correct and definitely the infallible word of God? You probably can't, because no one can.  Everything is just a theory, Evolution just as Creation...  So please do not ask questions where you know that people most likely can't give you a definite answer (because no one knows it) just to finally say that if Evolutionists can't prove it completely it most likely isn't true... We all know that ourselves...  There are no real answers to any of your questions... (yet)..."

fact_1168	fact	"That's just great. You think it is cruel to abort a fetus when the life of the mother is in danger. So what your really saying is: ""Oh just let the chick die, save that baby"". It strikes me as strange that you don't think letting that woman die would be cruel, or that the baby growing up without his mother would be cruel. And there would be no reason to do it to a ""born baby"". If they are already born, you cannot perform an abortion. And I think it is sickening that in this so called ""land of the free"" that there would even be an argument against an abortion done to prevent the death of the mother, or abortions done in the case of rape. I would think that the land of the free and the right to choose would go hand in hand. And let me ask you, with your demented, self righteous views, do you celebrate your birth date or your conception date?"

fact_2307	fact	So you don't have genes in your body that aren't activated? Aka my father has blue eyes and my mother brown eyes. I have 1 blue eye gene in my body yet I don't have 1 blue eye and 1 brown eye. But 2 brown eyes. So it's obviously not active.(ok bad example) Don't know the exact name for it. But don't rabbits have a genetic response hard coded. As every animal. That when they are being chased that they make irratic maneuvres. He says that the chickens had genes that had some hardcoded information about how to respond to certain conditions. They got activated in them. And the same information was passed to the children.   So they don't come out all big eyed and is mister big teeth my uncle?
fact_2313	fact	Because murder's already illegal and there's nothing more that can be done about it.
fact_295	fact	I can well believe that pandion cannot answer this question; no one can accurately answer it. We know that baldness, as a genetic condition, is polygenetic (ie it's controlled by multiple genes) and autosomal (the genes [or at least the bulk of them] do not reside on the X or Y chromosomes). Despite being autosomal, people appear statistically slightly more likely to exhibit balness if the trait comes from their mother's side of the family. Even if we knew precisely which genes were involved and which of those genes your kids had, we still cannot tell you the likihood of your children being bald. The chances of the gene combination being expressed in the correct way to cause baldness are dependent on age, hormone levels, stress and probably a variety of other environmental conditions.
fact_1785	fact	"I would say that the soul is that part of us that is immortal. It is our essence. Our personality may impact or is impacted by it, but I would say it is far more. Indeed, I would say it is what psychologists call emergent downward causality.  As for the role of God, science has not disproven any of it. Science has explained how things occur but that does not eliminate the possibility of god nor does it limit what god does. We would simply not be understanding gods fit in the science of it. That makes sense given that god is considered infinite and we are finite. I think the soul is what gives us the possibility of even imagining the infinite. The idea that we can see beyond what we are or even to conceptualize such things gives a clue that there is more to us than meets the eye.  I do not see why God and science cannot coexist. Even evolution and creation. Forget planting evidence. That is too far fetched. I would rather think that it is more likely that what God says actually fits the evidence even though we cannot understand it. I do not know about God or ""not god"" (if you will) but if there is a God then the idea that he is beyond what I can actually conceive and yet completely conceivable makes sense for that kind of being. It should be an apparent paradox to me. If it is not, then my concept of God is faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr to small to be of any use to anyone.  Huck."
fact_1791	fact	Actually, there is. Well over 200 trans-Neptunian objects have been directly imaged by various means. All but Pluto have been found since 1992, and way over half have been found since 1998. I notice that of your references, one was published early in the year that the first (third if you count Pluto and Charon) was discovered, another was published two years later, and the third was published in 1974(!). MY GOD!! 1974! I also notice that none of them have anything to do with comet origin.

fact_1961	fact	Sandy do you understand that if a star is one light year away, then we see the light from that star that left the star one year ago? So the star must be at least one year old.
fact_444	fact	"So your claim is that the laws of physics have changed? You see, it is not a matter of design. It is a matter of the physical limits of wood. Wood is flexable, and the longer the piece of wood, the more bend there is in it. Possibly you have seen a roof with wood supports that spans a large area. To do it requires huge trusses unless you add column supports. And I'll bet there aren't any spans of over 300 ft. where only a wood truss is used.  For a ship/barge the problem becomes worse. If you make the keel thick in an effort to reduce the hogging and snaking, you reduct the room available inside. Even at that, it would be impossible to eliminate all of the flexing and that flexing would spring the planks of the hull. There is no calking that has been devised that can fill an ever changing gap between planks.  And, of course, recourse to a miracle is the standard creationist answer when faced with evidence that their mythology isn't historic. ""POOF! Goddidit!"" And so, what is the point of the whole exercise in the first place? Why didn't God just POOF the ark into existance or just POOF anyone he didn't like out of existance? He wanted to teach the only just man in the world a lesson? Sure worked. First thing Noah did was to get drunk."
fact_1975	fact	There's much more to it than that. There are several different kinds of genetic changes that are called mutations. Evolution is not limited to the effects of point mutations alone. Why don't you demonstrate your competence to discuss this topic by defining a point mutation, and then name and define several other kinds of mutation.  And, of course, there are other mechanisms that increase the genetic variability in any population besides mutation. On the other hand, there are mechanisms that tend to reduce the variability in a population in addition to natural selection. Please name and explain at least 4 others in order that you do not continue to look like a fool.
fact_322	fact	And think of what other animals have built (and for an actual purpose). Take a look at a bee hive. It's so complex and so perfect for them. They built that. An ant hill is at least 20 times the size of an ant. That's 120 feet for us (for a 6 foot person).
fact_1020	fact	"So he failed to follow procedure? So was one of the procedures to assist the child in holding the gun while the gun was being fired and to not stand at a distance? If that's the case then the instructor at the firing range was also partially at fault because it was also his responsibility to supervise the child. And I just found this:  ""SPRINGFIELD, Mass. - Authorities in Massachusetts are considering whether criminal charges should be filed in the death of an eight-year-old boy who accidentally shot himself with an Uzi submachine-gun at a gun show.   ""Hampden County District Attorney William Bennett says he hasn't been able to find any law that would authorize a child to possess or fire a machine-gun.""  Criminal charges possible in boy's Uzi death, Massachusetts authorities say - Yahoo! Canada News   So not only is allowing children to fire machines guns irresponsible it may also be illegal."

fact_1034	fact	Why would gun haters like gun hater pilot say there are reasons to have guns? To answer this a person must know that the only reason the 2nd amend gives to bear arms is it is your right to!  The 2nd amend does not say people must be in a militia to bear arms!   The 2nd amend does not say people need guns for self defense!  The 2nd amend does not say people need guns to hunt with!  The 2nd amend does not say people need guns to target shoot with!  Gun hater pilot will then later start saying since we have a standing army there is no reason for militias.  Gun hater pilot will then say hey we have police to protect us, so why do people need guns to defend themselves.   Gun hater pilot will then say we have grocery store so why do people need to hunt?  Gun hater pilot will then say why do you need to target shoot if you no longer need guns to hunt or defend yourself?  Gun hater pilot will continue adding why do you need guns reasons until the reason gun hater pilot said are gone.  It is always interesting how gun haters like gun hater pilot apply the common sense lie to banning the right to bear arms.   What gun hater pilot will never apply the common sense thing is to demand that dangerous criminals be removed from the streets of America to make it safe.  The only paranoid people are the gun haters that want to ban the right to bear arms of law abiding citizens. Notice gun hater pilot did state if you cannot trust one person you must suspect all people! That is what being paranoid is!
fact_2273	fact	"It is 'change over time', not 'gradual change over time'. The morphological changes tend to happen with a change in the environment.   The difference between 'micro' evolution and 'macro' evolution is the number of steps. ""Macro"" evolution is a bunch of 'micro' evoltultions that add up. You have two populations that you can compare that used to interbreed, and for some reason, do not, and then you add on a few 1000 'mircro-evolution' events to each, they become very very different."

There were many typewritters around since, according this, 1714  ""The patent for the first typewritter was given to Henry Mill in 1714 but it had so many problems and was not able to be used. From there came William Burt in 1829 with the same idea to make a system of moving keys to be printed on paper; his as well was unsuccessful.

fact_1008	fact	One cannot have a controled experiment, as one can in the hard sciences. Psychology, anthropology and other disciplines also do not allow for controlled experiments. However, as with these other fields, one can do a detailed analysis of events that do occur to see if there is a common trend. For example, if people claim to see a supernatural event, take them aside separately to question them about the details. If one can be sure that they didn't get a chance to coordinate the details ahead of time and, nevertheless, the details match, then that would be evidence supporting the supernatural. If this happens consistently, then it would start giving strong support to the existence of a supernatural.  Unfortunately, though there are occasional events that remain unexplained, we all know that the great majority of events have not resulted in any conclusive evidence of a supernatural and often they are shown to be simply fraudulent or due to psychological misinterpretation. Since so many of these claims about the supernatural have proven to be dead ends, it is understandable that people should automatically be wary of anyone's claim toward supernatural proof, which has led to the very subject being essentially taboo in intellectual circles. That is unfortunate. If there actually was a supernatural and did manifest itself, then it might never be discovered because any genuine evidence presented would be automatically ignored because of the taboo.  The main challenge is to have the patience to weed through the thousands of bogus claims in the hope of finding something genuine - whether or not that hope ever gets fulfilled.

fact_108	fact	And right at the top of the list, at a whopping 31.2 per 100,000, is Washington DC, even though they had a complete and total gun ban in place. How the hell do you explain that? Nobody could own handguns, nobody could ever carry a gun, nobody could have a gun outside of their home, nobody could even load their private guns, so how do they get to be at the top of the list or death rates?
fact_1593	fact	Of course an explanation of artificial selection would talk about purpose. I'm not sure how that is meaningful to the discussion. And of course, mention of eugenics is irrelevant to natural selection.
fact_652	fact	Well, it seems pretty evident that you have know idea of the meaning of the word theory when used in science.
fact_134	fact	But of course! Of course you have to take into account all the input that any one system receives from all external sources in order to trace back to an initial state.   (No system can ever be truly closed, truly isolated from the rest of the universe, for what should be obvious reasons. Certain systems are only classified as 'closed' for experiments' sake because they have been very efficiently isolated and the parameters of unavoidable input are precisely calculable and can be subtracted from results, thereby giving the results that a truly closed system would provide.) In your pool-shot example below, for instance, the initial state must take account of the wear & tear of the table, the strength of the cue, the slope of the floor, humidity, temperature and every other variable.  So any such 'backtracking' (which is highly hypothetical given the extreme complexity of the calculations) has to take into account the knowledge that no system is isolated. This is part of what chaos theory attempts to do, and why chaos theory must deal in probabilities until we have computers ordres of magnitude more powerful than we do today.

fact_1544	fact	Thank the lord you are not a creationist (pardon the pun). The method you referred to above is known as deductive reasoning, and is known to be a very valid way of finding a solution even by most 3rd graders. Also, I look at the Bible as a written record of what actually happened as well as the holy book. Seeing as scientists have believed the journals of young Native Americans from a hundred years ago, I don't see the problem of believing the written journal of hundreds of very wise men and women, including God himself.
fact_875	fact	Because self-defence, unlike most other 'reasons', automatically allows all citizens firearm access, and in most cases allows firearm acess without mandatory training/evaluation. When this occurs, you are much more likely to get misuse of firearms.  If you read around you'll see that I consider all rights as needing justification. This comes both from my stance as a relativist and as a UK citizen, where there is no formalised Constitution. Ask yourself this - if a right cannot be justified, why should it be treated as a 'right'?

If God chose to reveal to you in some special way, the origins of the universe, for you to write down for generations to come.. you would write a different story than Moses. Just as one person views art differently from another person.  I see no duplicity between the two.
fact_1550	fact	"But it's not detecting any ""new"" wavelength. It's just detecting a wavelength that our eyes are incapable of detecting. You can't see radio waves, so radio waves are meaningless to your eye, but they're not meaningless to your clock radio receiver."
fact_861	fact	This is where intuitive, ready agreement with the opening paragraph starts to get the reader into trouble. All facts are interpreted according to presuppositions, so it's only fair that Creationists should get to bring their presuppositions to the table just like everyone else, right?  Well, let's apply that same blanket reasoning to other situations and see what happens. Imagine a juror whose personal prejudices lead him to presuppose the guilt of a defendant based on her skin colour, and to interpret the facts of the case accordingly. Should he be allowed to sit in judgement? Of course not - but according to the reasoning presented by AiG that leaves us in an impossible position: by eliminating those jurors predisposed to return a guilty verdict based upon race, we necessarily cede the court to those predisposed to return an innocent verdict based upon race.  Our intuition rightly rebels at this false dichotomy. We readily apprehend the existence of a middle ground wherein skin colour confers neither automatic guilt nor automatic innocence. Ah, but! Is that neutrality itself not merely another presupposition, another axiom through which the facts are being interpreted? One might protest that it is not, that the irrelevance of skin colour as a determinant of guilt can be determined empirically. But it would be in vain, because there are, after all, no such thing as 'brute facts'. The data you supply to justify your position only do so when interpreted according to your presupposition that guilt can be race-agnostic. To someone whose presupposition is otherwise, your 'facts' mean something quite different - they might for instance mean the research itself must be corrupt and biased, or at least faulty in some unknown way.  In short, following Ken Ham's reasoning we find ourselves deep in a rabbit hole with no end in sight. We can venture to justify no opinion or belief, because the facts that appear to support one may upon the least whim be reinterpreted in the light of another. I may if I so choose presuppose the bible to be the work of the devil himself, and I am not to be chastised nor deterred through argument, for the axioms by which I choose to interpret the world are, in Ken's eyes, inviolate.  This is hardly the result Ken could have intended. What's gone wrong? Why has his fair-minded attempt to level the playing field backfired so badly?  The answer, of course, is that the playing field isn't really level.  Every once in a while someone will decide that he can fly, and attempt to demonstrate this facility to the world by leaping from a high place. The world thus far has remained largely unimpressed. This is an extreme example of what can happen when the axioms one uses to interpret the world conflict with those upon which it really operates, and it provides the first key to unlocking our dilemma:  Good axioms yield accurate predictions.  As Ken rightly observed, known facts are always subject to interpretation. But the reverse process, the prediction of facts yet to come based on a formulated theory, is not. In making a prediction we are forced to stop shoehorning data into our preconceived worldview and make a statement about what we will find. This yields the closest thing we have to a truly objective measurement of congruence between theory and reality.  This understanding allows us to validate or repudiate the presuppositions we bring to bear on the facts at our disposal. The racist juror would from the outset predict the evidence to be presented would turn out to be stacked against the defendant, but his low 'hit rate' would invalidate his axiom.  So, part of what distinguishes Creationism from mainstream scientific understanding is that, in hindsight and on an ongoing basis its predictions fall wide of the mark. The discovery of shared pseudogenes should have been all but impossible, as should identically located retroviral insertions. We should not have found fossils at all, let alone a nested hierarchy of forms. We should not have been able to observe evolution and speciation. We should not have been able to see very distant stars and galaxies.  All of these unexpected face-plants for Creationism have of course been rationalised away after the fact. Shared pseudogenes must all have some function we don't know about; there must be some determinism in the location of ERVs; fossils and the geological column were all laid down in the Great Flood; the speed of light and the rate of decay of radioactive materials were different in the past. But these rationalisations entail further predictions: we ought not to be able to safely remove pseudogenes if they are functional - but we can. If ERV insertion is deterministic we should see that in the lab - but we don't. If fossils were laid down by the flood we wouldn't expect similar animals to be sorted by depth according to the number of cusps on a back tooth, or to be buried in amongst consistent strata of pollen grains, and we wouldn't expect there to be anything like as much limestone. If decay rates had been high enough in the past to explain what we see today in just 10,000 years, we ought to now be breathing incandescent rock vapour instead of air. And so on.  Science also changes to accommodate the unexpected - but as often as not the 'unexpected' has been discovered by scientists extrapolating existing theories to their logical conclusions, predicting something we didn't initially suspect but which has later been confirmed. And that's the bottom line: Creationism and science both evolve as new facts emerge, but while the result for science has been a trend towards better and more accurate predictions, indicative of closing the gap between theory and reality, Creationism remains a tumbling snowball of post-hoc rationalisation growing around a hard core of sacred axioms that - it would certainly appear thus far - make it impossible for the convergence of prediction and reality to occur.
fact_2059	fact	You have ignored a third option, my denier of all that is right and good. That third option is the one you atheists and secular humanists refuse to consider, and that is that God spoke the stars into creation at the same time as Genesis says He spoke everything into existence in 6 days time as Genesis declares.   What is dishonest and deceptive about your position is to then extrapolate from that info that it is God who is being deceptive. It is like saying that because you reject the gospel of Jesus as I accurately and honestly share it with you, that it is me lying about that gospel because you have rejected it. It is the most irrational and dishonest reasoning possible, yet it defines the way your minds work. emoticonXDonno
fact_1578	fact	And again, but no other animal that can fly has also conquered breathing under water as we have, or has learned to travel on land faster than the fastest mammal can run. But we fly, breathe underwater and travel faster than a cheetah as if it was second nature. No other animal in creation has attained what we have, or even come close. As I said, only humanity has evolved past having to survive in the natural World as all other animals on Earth do.

fact_691	fact	I agree that all other reasonably safe options (such as caesarian delivery, in womb operations, etc.) should be looked into before resorting to abortion in that third trimester. As with the example of the friend of jitobear, sometimes there is just not a reasonably safe option for a particular woman since her conditions might not allow those alternate procedures.  As for the question of limits on the health exception, yes, the exceptions that are clearer to me are the ones that could ultimately lead to the mother's death or complete debilitation. However, there is also a gray region that I am undecided on.  For example:  - What if the pregnancy would lead to less critical loss - such as the loss of use of her legs or arms? What about one limb - such as the use of one arm?  - What if the pregnancy would give a medium chance of loss - such as a 20% chance of paralysis?  The gray region is harder to quantify and the moral balance gets trickier. Perhaps that is why this issue hasn't really been addressed specifically in law. Where decisions in morally gray regions are concerned, it is too easy to criticize them and politically unwise to venture into that territory.
fact_2071	fact	And what type of objectivist views do you have toward gay issues if I may ask?      I'm assuming gay issues may seem irrelevant since they probably don't pertain to you well, cause your not gay....

fact_685	fact	And upon what grounds do you base this claim? Government chooses not to recognize different types of marriages all the time, not just same sex marriages ie. polygamist marriages, relatives, age limits, etc. These recognitions are not only federal but vary state to state, for instance some states recognize 1st cousin marriages while others don't, as I recall, the age of consent to marry also differs among states.
fact_1554	fact	What's wrong with that? Lots!  Rational thought alone keeps a person from doing just anything s/he wants. Should I, an atheist, kill another personâs children just to see if that person will then hate me? No, I shouldnât. Doing so would be grossly immoral. I guess God couldnât figure that one out for himself â¦ poor Job â¦ poor Jobâs children.  Thereâs also the simple fact that we moral humans recognize the difference between being treated fairly and unfairly, and we even feel empathy, both of which even chimps seem to do at at least a rudimentary level. So do you argue that chimps must already believe in God?  It doesn't take religion to know of fairness or to be able to put oneself in another's shoes and consider how that person would feel based on our actions.
fact_865	fact	He was at various different observatories.  I've never heard of Mt. Carmel.   He worked at Lick and Palomar. (Wait I think Lick is on Mt. Carmel maybe?)  Who cares.  When and where was he BARRED from using these telescopes?  Please provide a link.  When and where was he BARRED from presenting his evidence?  Please provide a link.  He published plenty of papers and he even has websites and books.  But, he only had a few images supporting his hypohtesis that quasars are ejecta from odd galaxies. They also had many various doubts associated with them.  If he had presented hundreds of examples of these things that had no other explanation they would have taken it more seriously (not that these things weren't taken seriously since they were).  He didn't. No one else has come across these things other than one or two that I am aware of, and these are also explained away.  He wasn't fired for just suggesting that the BB was wrong.  If so he would have been fired in the sixties.  I don't even think he was fired but I haven't found info on this.  I found this page though:  http://www.astroleague.org/al/obsclu...c/arphalt.html

The professor attempts to discredit choice by stating there's no proof it is and promote genetics even without any scientific basis to do so. His selective use of ""lack of proof"" as his main criteria is dubious as a result.   Some make the claim that nobody would âchooseâ to be gay because of all of the psychological baggage that comes with it. The teasing from straights, the parental pressure, etc., but we know that rebellious teens will do a lot of anti-social things by choice, so that argument doesnât fly."
fact_1540	fact	Well the government track record in health care isn't too good. Medicare is broke and busted by their own accounts. So if they can't run that correctly by what stretch of the imagination do you come up with them being able to manage the whole healthcare industry? Medicaid is broke. The VA healthcare system is a shambles. You would think they would get them up and running smoothly before trying to sell us the snake oil of their healthcare. Then there is the big problem of rationing. No matter what lies are told, health care is rationed in socialized medicine.

fact_2049	fact	"As for myself, I have serious concerns about research done by Lott.  ""Lott has been unable to provide evidence to back up his claim that 98% of defensive gun uses don't involve the firing of the weapon. When questioned Lott has changed his story several times about where he got the 98% statistic from. The validity of other statistics in his book are also in question because he didn't control for such factors as poverty and drug use. David Mustard, co-author of Lott's study, admitted under oath in Klein v. Mustard that the study left out certain variables which are relevant to the crime rate. Gary Kleck, a pro-gun advocate and researcher, commented on this '[More]likely, the declines in crime, coinciding with relaxation of carry laws were largely attributable to other factors not controlled for in the Lott and Mustard analysis'(Targeting Guns; p. 372).While the case against Lott may not be as strong as the case against Bellesiles, enough questions have been raised about Lott's book that it would be wise to refrain from relying too much on his research.""  http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg...stomer-reviews"

fact_2075	fact	For the final compilation, yes, but the vast majority, certainly the Gospels and the first few Pauline epistles, were widely accepted long before that, and were regarded as authoritative in the early 2nd century.

fact_695	fact	The Sun was crucial in the evolution of most life on the planet, but it may not have been the main cause of the very beginning of life. There are hypotheses that energy necessary, chemical catalysts available, Carbon, Nitrogen, Hydrogen, but not Oxygen apart from being part of the Water molecule. There are tectonic activated hot springs and chimneys in the deep sea. There is an availability of Sulfur, heat energy, and the triggering of a Sulphur based metabolism. It was internal energy from up welling and down welling of hot magma which in turn was fuelled by core radioactivity. Some even speculate that the very centre of the core may be pure Uranium.  However, there is no need to debate the Second Law of Thermodynamics. It is a ruse by Magical Creationists who deliberately and in my opinion deceptively make Earth a closed entropy system.  Cuchulainn  PS: Fundies have an obligation to show why the fires of Hell are exempt from the 2nd Law. I already know the answer. Hell is imaginary and imaginary things do not gain entropy.:)

fact_1583	fact	No, they're the same species. If you put all these fish in the same pool at the end they would all breed with each other. The example wasn't of speciation, merely of a change in a population driven by the environment, which is the essense of evolution.

Warning: You are no the actual buyer if you are acquiring the firearm(s) on behalf of another person. If you are not the actual buyer, the dealer cannot transfer the firearm(s) to you.  Sarah Brady lied on the background check form, she bought the gun on behalf of her son and supplied it to him, thus ensuring that he wouldn't have to worry about the NICS check red flagging him.

fact_1756	fact	"**  The ""methodology"" of science is not materialism/mechanism/darwinism, but simply empiricism leading inductively/abductively to hypotheses regarding regularities in causation in nature that can be tested via the predictive experimentation of the scientific method. Neither empiricism or the epistemological process of the scientific method are the exclusive property of materialism/mechanism, nor did they originate from within that metaphysic, despite the beliefs of materialist/mechanists to that effect.  Unfortunately, some 150 years ago, that methodology was set aside, and has remained out of sight, with regard to the hypothesis that is generally referred to as 'darwinism'."
fact_1742	fact	No one said otherwise and it is still irrelevant.
fact_1024	fact	That's just not true. It is a logical fallacy.

Sonograms are great tool for understanding more to those women who have doubt. I don't know about you, but I'm all for empowerment with knowledge. Most people are ""VISUAL"" people and perhaps seeing the unborn may make the CHOICE clearer for the woman.   I'm for educating those from ALL PERSPECTIVES.

fact_1795	fact	Well, if you want to tell the truth, the theory of evolution is NOT a religion, it involves no magical deities, it takes nothing on faith. And since creation involves supernatural forces that are supported by absolutely NO evidence, it is not a scientific theory.
fact_468	fact	"Well, there's plenty of scientific evidence about fetal development, such that we can confidently say no ""person"" is established up to a certain stage in a pregnancy.  I think the decision should be up to the woman, as under U.S. law. Between her and her doctor, whoever else she freely chooses to share with. I think, at some point, in a normally developing pregnancy, a very fuzzy looking line is crossed. But that's why we have state regulations during the third trimester.  IMO, Latin American countries, until this day, are unduly under the influence of the Church, superstition and ignorance."
fact_1959	fact	There is nothing religious about babies....   They should be concerned with preventing the death of an innocent person... who made no mistakes, violated no laws, and whos only crime is existance.  if you dont think courts can protect babies, then do you.. deserve any protection?  If a baby can be killed simply because it is an inconvience... then why does it suddenly become a crime if the baby is 2 days old?  what difference is there between a child in the womb, and one which was just born?  its still the same baby.  The point is.. we can prevent all these reckless abortions, if... if... if.. we can convince all these wild loose sex acts... to be done with a condom...  Guys dont like condoms....  They must be made to recognise that they cannot simply walk away.  The only time, the girl will give the name... is when the guy made promises, and refuses to marry... refuses to care.. and the girl is left alone.  in those cases the bastards deserve to do hard labor, for atleast 3 months.

fact_1781	fact	Its odd that you would use that concept at all. Do you really think terms used to describe power structures in human organizations are applicable to cells and their subsystems? Genes are the heritable information store of cells, they perform their function, other subsystems perform other functions. The whole constitutes a living cell. The whole who is on top thing is an inapplicable concept. What counts is understanding the functions of the various subsystems. A cell is not a dominance heiracrchy.
fact_2288	fact	No argument. But the thread start started with how Europe was going to be Arab due to all the non-Arabs having all these abortions - - well not that many of them are.
fact_326	fact	Oh, it certainly is an issue. Martin Killias, a Swiss criminologist, did find a link between gun ownership and homicide in Switzerland. However, my point was to ask you if you would be willing to abide by such regulations. The law in Switzerland requires that military weapons kept in the home be unloaded and stored under lock and key.  I don't think Switzerland is a gun-nut utopia.
fact_440	fact	"You'll find that abortion targets none of these: ""national, ethnical, racial or religious group(s).""   Unwanted, unborn children is not a specific group. Nor are members of any group specifically targeted for abortion. The practice in open to all in the US.  Sorry. But all that shows is an abundant level of ignorance.  Now, if you can show that abortion is only used to cull the Romany populations in East Europe...then you may have a point."
fact_1971	fact	According to history. I see you litterally ignored how it was wrong when one looks at how blacks were treated. How does it not? Blacks were paid less because they were black, Black soldiers weren't sent to fight because they were black. Black officers couldn't even command moderate level units. Black soldiers were treated as slaves when captured and often executed, not even afforded the rights of captured white northern soldiers. In fact it went so far as if a White officer in command of a black unit was captured, he was executed because he commanded a black unit. White officers captured from white units were treated as prisoners. White soldiers who didn't even speak english recruited off immigrantion ships from Europe were paid the normal amount. White soldiers were sent to fight, not sent to dig fortifications or ditches or latrines. Blacks were not treated equally in any way during the war, and reconstroction period in the north and the south shows a stark contrast in a belief of unequal creation. I suggest you go back and learn something about the war before talking about it.
fact_454	fact	It's interesting that you mention this because this was actually prophesied right from the beginning by God. Down through the centuries, women have been mistreated and often considered to be second-rate humans. This is because of imperfection, an imperfection that God could foresee:  âYour craving will be for your husband, and he will dominate you.â (Genesis 3:16)  Obviously men are not without blame too, but ultimately, due to disobedience to God, both Adam and Eve have had to pay the price and so have their offspring.

fact_332	fact	What makes you think I am using âthemâ as a source? I would suggest you read the story you âread aboutâ again. It is Nathanson, not âpeopleâ, who makes the claim. However saying someone lied and proving that they did are two entirely different things. Nathanson said they liedâ¦he hasnât proved it as such.  Secondly, the figures you speak of that were supposedly based on lies is only exclusive to after the 1950s. We are talking about the 1930s.   Lastly, using figures after the 1940s is highly skewed; therapeutic abortion was pretty much Roe v Wade lite and eliminated the use of criminal abortion in the middle and upper classes.   Now, lets get to the facts. Our overall abortion rate was 22.9 in 1996 according to the Alan Guttmacher Institute. In 1930, Hamiliton published the rate of abortion in 1930 in specific social and economic groups in, âSome Sociologic and Psychologic Observations on Abortion.â The abortion rate in those of the upper/middle class was 24.3, for poor unmarried white women it was 64% and for minorities the abortion rate was 40%.   So women were aborting probably about a third of their pregnancies in the 1930s. Stixâs, âA Study of Pregnancy Wastageâ puts the abortion rate at 35 percent or 35 abortions per 100 live births.

As for the absence of some verses form various versions/editions of the bible - I have had that problem too, and not just with quotes form ""infidels."" For example, many versions have 're-interpreted' or re-translated' various verses to reflect certain political views and ideologies (which I find disgusting). For example, I have heard of a version that now singles out ""abortionists"" as evil-doers, and I have had a hard time tracking down online bibles that contain the actual KJV of Luke 14:26 - many have removed the word ""hate"" and replaced with a more conservatively correct ""love less"", which is not even what the original Greek was...  So, not being able to find certain verses does not mean that they are made-up or otherwise inaccurate, it may be that various versions have altered/omitted some of them..."

fact_285	fact	BWWWWAAAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! Are you trying to be deceptive or is it that you really didn't understand what you read? It's really pretty simple. The first link does not suggest that man arose in China. It is a discussion of a primate fossil. While humans are primates, all primates are not necessarily humans. The article discusses a primate fossil, the oldest yet discovered. It does not claim that mankind arose in China.  Your second link leads to a discussion of well known human fossils from the middle pleistocene or later. None of them are as old at the Australopithecine fossils of Africa. Maybe you didn't read you own links, but I don't see any claim of the origin of mankind in China. The claim is that early hominids (Homo erectus) migrated to China from Africa. The oldest H. erectus fossils are found in Africa and it would therefore seem that that is the origin of the species.
fact_1187	fact	Yep. But our ancestors lived in an area of abundant fruit, and we got all we needed from our diets, so it was no big thing when the gene broke. A few non-primate organisms also have it broken, but it's broken in a different way.  Barbarian observes:  It's remarkable then, how much progress we've made. You may or may not approve of the theory, but it works very well at learning more about biology.

I weighed 85 lbs, so it is not something that you are going to see guys running around in (though I do have several sets that we constructed for the testing that I could sell for around $200,000.00 each).   You MIGHT have feed problems (we did) with the round, in which case you need to take a dremel and smooth out your feed ramp. No big deal. Out of a makarov (short barrel) we were getting around 2850 FPS. Out of a bizon (15 inch barrel) we were at about 3000 FPS, well into rifle velocity land.   The REAL benifit to a round like this (since I assume that most people are not simply looking to load cop killers) is that you have in inherently stable round, the .223, being fired at near rifle velocity, from a pistol. The round is stable to roughly 150 yards, then it begins to deteriorate. 3"" groupings at 100 yards with our old POS test weapon were not uncommon. 1.5"" with the bizon."

fact_2101	fact	"""The right was in the context of the citizen soldier of the conscript militia. In the eighteenth century private arms were never strictly private. The public had a claim for public purposes. Coxe was a strong Federalist. He was employed in Hamilton's Treasury Department during the Whiskey Rebellion. He expressed no concerns that the enrollment and inventory requirements of the Militia Act would infringe on right of the people to keep and bear their private arms.""  http://www.potowmack.org/thequotes.html#coxe  So Tench Coxe put quite a bit a faith in the power of the militia? George Washington and Alexander Hamilton didn't agree. They thought that the militia was no match for a regular army.   ""Regular troops alone are equal to the exignencies of modern war, as well for defense as for offense.... No militia will ever acquire the habits necessary to resist regular force.... The Firmness requisite for the real business of fighting is only to be attained by a constant course of discipline and service. I have never been yet been witness to a single instance that would justify a different opinion.""  (Letter from George Washington to the President of Congress- September 15,1780)  ""Here I expect we shall be told that the militia of the country is its  natural bulwark, and would be at all times equal to the national  defense. This doctrine, in substance, had like to have lost us our  independence. It cost millions to the United States that might have been  saved. The facts which, from our own experience, forbid a reliance of  this kind, are too recent to permit us to be the dupes of such a  suggestion. The steady operations of war against a regular and  disciplined army can only be successfully conducted by a force of the  same kind."" -Alexander Hamilton  http://federalistpapers.com/federalist25.html"
fact_939	fact	So what? The fact remains that Britain is still four times as dangerous as America in terms in crime rates. Or are you arguing that their crime level is acceptable and that you're alright with so many more people being a helpless victim unable to do anything?
fact_1408	fact	"I see myself as just as capable of swinging from being responsibile, safe and trustworthy into irresponsible, dangerous and untrustworthy. I believe every humans possess the ability to to do so, but not nessesarily through the involvement of firearms.  Although i must reiterate the words ""responsibility, dangerous and trustworthy"" are entire being of a subjective, circumstantial situation."
fact_1385	fact	Actually no. You read the article again, and thoroughly this time.
fact_1391	fact	You are, in effect, telling me that putting someone in a position that will inevitable leave them dead does not make you responsible for their death. If I fire a bullet at your head, while that bullet is in mid-air, I am no longer doing anything to hurt you, and you are fine. However, I have set in motion affects that will result in your demise. This makes me responsible for your death.

fact_722	fact	That's a completely different argument, order does not imply a creator.
fact_723	fact	Yes, but this is why I brought up the bible, because that would be an alternate reason that would not be caused by homosexual brains that could occur in cultures supportive of homosexuality. I believe that you are right about Japanese culture, if you delved into it you would find there is not a genetic but cultural cause for their high suicide rates, but I believe that you would find the same thing with homosexuality.
fact_737	fact	Well this is what i am saying. The probability of a and b in one organism i very low. And the probability of A and B in many generations is lower than just A. This is what Behe deals with in his book. One reason evolution of primates interest me more than bacteria is the the number of organisms and generations is much much lower, and the changes involved must be pretty big. It involves Real evolution as opposed to stuff like antibiotic resistance or sicke cell haemoglobin that i see more as a reversable adaption, not a developement to a permanently better/more complex state.   IMO there should be possible to make some sort of calculation regarding the probability of RM being cause of the changes.

fact_1353	fact	Well, I think it is best to use a real source. Like the Australian FBI, called the A.I.C..  The latest figures.   Violent crimes from 1996 to 2007 (per 100,000 persons per year)   Homicide is pretty much a flat line no? However there violent crime is not. And to be fair, Australia's murder rate has always been significantly lower then ours and they should be congratulated for there socialization for it too.  So if gun related crime goes down but the murder rate remains relatively flat, but other violent crimes go up, then what is thew point of mentioning that GUN Related crime went down?
fact_1435	fact	Incorrect- I think Olsen is very specific in citing those he feels have overstepped the mark in this instance. He is not ruling out the possibility of a link at all- he (rightly IMO) is targeting certain workers and publications.

fact_1810	fact	As I pointed out, you don't understand what either evolution or natural selection are. Evolution is a change in the relative frequencies in inheritable characteristics in a population over generations. If the number of long haired animals became more frequent in the population, then evolution has occurred. Natural selection may (or may not) be the mechanism that caused the change.
fact_247	fact	Well I think that the geology of the planet would influence everything. From religions to morals and scientific progression. Because long ago on our planet Europe not only thought the world was flat and they could fall over at the edge into an abyss but Europe generally didn't have knowledge of the Asian cultures until the silk road was active. If the asian and european cultures were not so greatly distanced from each other history would have been greatly changed to the extent that compared to our world would be pretty loopy:p
fact_253	fact	You speak as if these two things are mutually exclusive, they are not. Government control of guns only works on those willing to obey the law. Government cannot control criminals, they can and should however punish them when they catch them.  Allow me to ask you a question: Which is more important a perceived saftey via government control or the freedoms endowed by our creator and enumerated in the bill of rights?  I asked you before (you didn't answer) what rights are you willing to give up for what you perceive as a safer life? You once posted that you were studied in the ways of Joseph Smith and Brigham Young, as it could be argued that religion has killed more people then cancer would you be willing to give up that freedom? How about if the government said you can own a Bible but not a Koran? Or you could only buy one religios text per month?

fact_1838	fact	"Exactly, there is absolutely no evidence that biologists could show you that would make you think, ""hey that would count of as transitional. Why? Because you have already accepted your previous convictions and closed your mind to anything new. How about doing what Porky Pine asked and giving us your definition of a transitional form?  If you have spent any time at University, you should know that references older than 10 years shouldn't be used. Science has usually progressed sufficiently in this time, so that the information in the older articles/books, probably contains errors or invalid information.  Scientists contradict each other all the time? It's the first step in finding correct answers. New hypotheses are proposed and tested, observations made etc and falsified ideas are discarded. It's what makes it work."
fact_2302	fact	Well, no, it doesn't. That's sort of the point of the article I linked to. No organismic response, no hypermutable state (apart from one coincidentally arising in a minority of the adaptive population), no EAM.  L&D, as an experiment, had its limitations, namely the lethality of the selective environment. What the article I linked to demonstrates is that Cairns&Foster also has limitations. Most of the time, it should be remembered, the C&F methodology yields the same results as L&D; the circumstances yielding the anomalous results that were a temporary shot-in-the-arm for Lamarckism were very particular. The bacteria had to possess a leaky allele that still operated at a low efficiency, and that functionality had to be just barely inhibited by scavenger cells.  C&F still did something useful: it highlighted the potential importance of amplification mutagenesis, where genes that do a slightly useful job accumulate under selection, increasing the chances that a more successful variant of the gene will arise within any given population.  I'll check out the other experiment you mention; thanks for clearing that up.

fact_284	fact	I'd love to see an explanation about how the study of the natural world disproves the existence of all Deities. Especially the Deistic Gods. And I'd love to see how science is suppose to disprove a being that is not bound by logic, reason or any laws. What science can do is disprove that God was directly responsible for this or that, the sun rising, the rain season, etc. Did you perhaps realize that many scientists are Buddhists because Buddhism which has beings that behave as Gods with such powers and exist partially within the natural and supernatural? Or are you again assuming all religions don't exist except for Christanity?

fact_1151	fact	You mean, in ways that are different from your pet version? WW, what defines materialism - the phenomena it recognises - if not their susceptibility to the scientific method?   Science is more than a methodology. Empiricism and validation by prediction from anticipated regularit is its methodology. If science were nothing more than a methodology, than no science would exist beyond the confines of any particular experiment and/or collection of observations/measurements undergone currently.

When a human (actually, in the case of the Jews, humanS) make efforts to completely eliminate a race or religious group of people and there Book (the Bible) for over thousands upon thousands of years, and the people and Book are still preserved, that is evidence of a God, in my opinion.

But the KT boundary was dated using several radiometric methods that all agree to within a couple of million years.  Here is where I got that info:  http://www.ncseweb.org/resources/rnc...12_30_1899.asp  Look at table 2.
fact_1780	fact	The National Guard interpretation of the militia is totally false. The NG is a standing army. The militia is not. The NG can be federalized. The militia can not. They wear the same uniforms. The officers all know each other and play golf together.  If the NG is the militia, then I want to have stock plies of weapons at schools, hospitals, libraries, and churches. No federalization of NG. Complete and total seperation of NG from federal influence, communication, and socializatlion, right down to even different uniforms.
fact_1958	fact	Clearly this is true. There are a multitude of denominations from every religion. This is as specially true with Christianity because the texts do not explain how all the ceremonies are done. Baptism was performed in areas where full immersion could not have occurred but the best explanations of baptism paint a picture of a full immersion. The Church of Christ believes one must baptize in the name of Jesus, the Father, Son and Holy Ghost thing was while Jesus lived. Because the practice of speaking in tongues was used by the first church, some believe the art must stay in the church.  Most of the complications to Christianity is simply because the followers really believed Jesus would return. No one wrote a book on the Religion.  The Religion changed a great deal through time. King James was no saint and he had clear reasons he would not allow some letters into an authorized version he would sign on to.  One letter spoke of the sin of Slavery. This was clearly at odds with King James. Other items would have direct negative effects on the kingdom and I'll let others find the reasoning behind the withdraws.
fact_469	fact	"Actually, no. It has been quite conclusively shown that the theory of relativity is correct. It is the sign of a scientific illiterate to claim that a theory is somehow doubted because it hasn't been ""proven."" No theory grows up to be a law."
fact_1794	fact	Nope not kidding. Matter has a CONTINUUM of complexity. At some point in that CONTINUUM we assign (in a rather imprecise way) the property of Life to the matter concerned. Other less complex matter is assigned the abstract property dead or non-living. If you were more familar with the true range of complexity which matter exhibits you would be aware that the division is rather arbitrary. For example people have much difficulty on agreeing on whether viruses are living or non-living matter. And its clear that while you cannot analyze complexity in matter that it does exist. Its there and its real and its a lot more real than simple taxonomic categories like lfe and non-life are.
fact_2276	fact	That logic can be applied to weeds or trees. Anything that is non-sentient, or non-mental existant. Should we make gardening illegal too? The thing is, you have no base for calling it a human being or giving it the same rights as us. Human beings are, by nature, sentient. That is what makes us different from wildlife. When that only difference is separated, then it should not share the same rights as you or me. An accurate analogy would be someone who's brain was ripped out and was kept on life support. It would only be a body, no person inside of it. Same goes with an embryo. It simply cannot override the rights of its host.
fact_496	fact	Not really when you consider the gun laws of the UK, and how they were changed to prevent incidents like Cumbria from ever happening.

fact_482	fact	Yes but as you know some breasts resemble some sponges its not too big a jump to get from one to the other and of course there are other spongy tissues derived in the same way. This was all published as an appendix to the Book of Official Rules which is an addendum to The One True Book of the Round Church of which I am the hereditary pope. However I have lent my copy out and its not available on the web.
fact_2262	fact	"Well of course everybody is entitled. But as history has shown many southern states in America chose to ignore the Constitution and deny black people their rights on the basis of their skin color, using the ""black codes"" enacted after the Civil War. If it weren't for the 14th Amendment that forced state governments to abide by the constitution, minorities would still be out in the cold.  The only thing we've been over, is that government and gun control is racist, not the Second Amendment."
fact_1743	fact	As I said the gene was from its inception a theoretical construct developed to explain certain observations on pea plant characteristics. A convenience in describing how the traits were observed to be inherited. Its never been hard linked to any specific molecular architecture except for the short period of the one-gene one-enzyme (or protein) hypothesis. The concept grows more and more complex at the molecular level, but it also remains viable as a means of describing and studying the heritable elements underlying phenotypic traits at the conceptual level. Thats a tribute to the initial mental feat of Mendel in coming up with the original concept!  By the way there are no points or lines or squares or circles etc. Geometry must be dead don't ya think?
fact_1025	fact	"Strawman. Evolution is a process, it's not ""creating"" anything.  Fallacy: The first law of thermodynamics states that energy can neither be created nor destroyed. It's the conservation of energy. It has nothing to do with the reorganization of matter and/or energy into other forms. Whatsoever.  No fallacy here on their side, but you're doing pretty good for your first point on your side."
fact_1031	fact	No nation is perfect, Rev. Not even the USA! A singular instance that you quote is not an argument as anyone can just as easily find criticism with the USA over people freed early from jail.  You will find black people over-represented in the jails of the UK, the USA and Australia. There is injustice everywhere.
fact_1757	fact	It was in the news for a while and I'm pretty sure the inquiry found that it was a terrible misfortune based on miscommunication between the hospital and the parents. There was no selling of stolen dead babies for profit type of business going on with is what Fishx implies with the first post.  Sorry, didn't mean to offend there but I still think its better than another baby has a chance to live than pretty much anything with respect to the desceased. If it happened to me I would have no problem at all about any of my organs being used to save lives, either directly or indirectly through training of more doctors or research. Yet, I still respect your wishes and said before that if this is going to happen it should certainly be cleared with the parents first. You're just going to have to accept my appologies and realise that I have no idea what you went through, having not been there myself.  Being in an abortion forum, and the nature of the first post it seemed very quite possible that Fishx had had an abortion, though regretted it and wanted the remains to bury - this is a very different case than the one you have unfortunately experienced, hence the question.

fact_657	fact	First off, I think NATO had a pretty good point. What makes you think that every person shot was a pure victim?  Second, is that why crime rates have gone down in DC after Heller vs DC and why they went down after Florida Shall Issue laws were reinstated?  I'm guessing thats also why New York City and Chicago have such low crime rates, right? emoticonXRolleyes
fact_643	fact	What laws are these that you speak of? Kindly provide the bill name and number so you have some actual proof and aren't simply parroting from the fear-mongering Brady Campaign and Violence Policy Center.  During World War II the American people rounded up Japanese-Americans and herded them into concentration camps because you were at war with the people of Japan and thought that they were the sleeping enemy even though they had no proof. What you're speaking of is no different than this.  The way I see it Brady, your hatred for guns and gun owners is so overwhelming and logic defying, that you'd be perfectly alright with unleashing a life-ending pandemic plague on the people of earth if you believed it would put an end to all gun owners everywhere.

fact_2060	fact	"We don't ignore it. We look at the circumstances-all these stories are from civilizations/groups that live on or near flood plains. Floods are common place. Catastrophic floods, not so much.  You, however, must ignore things.   For example; where is the global layer of sediments which the flood would have had to have laid down? Such a sediment layer would be quite thick, and uniformly found around the globe, and would consist of particles sorted by density. We would expect to find no signs of life within this layer (no tracks or burrows, and no signs of growing plant life such as paleosols are tree roots). This sedimentary layer would show signs of being layed down in water. As well, any animal fossils (plant too), would be indiscrimately mixed. We would expect, for example, to find trilobites alongside modern day rays, rabbits with velociraptors, etc.  Now, can you point out where such a global layer exists Archie? If it doesn't, that pretty much debunks the flood ""theory"". But you just ignore that don't you?"
fact_858	fact	"No worries mate. Brooklyn&#39;s 81st Precinct probed by NYPD for fudging stats; felonies allegedly marked as misdemeanors  New York cops 'fudge' stats like the Tories to make their ""strict gun laws"" look more compatible to the States that do not have draconian anti gun laws and need not depend on the cops protecting you when they have no duty to do so.  I have been following UK stats for a long time and no matter who is in power, the crime rates increase. Often the perp is set free and the victem is the one punished like the incident you mentioned: Pushing someone out the way while attempting to escape is a violent crime under UK law.  Gun control is not crime control! It is just more evident in the UK. At least here you can still shoot the _____________s and that is a great deterrant :)"

fact_680	fact	Yes.      (and this is to add stuff to make the post stick....)
fact_1227	fact	Not really. That's the fallacy of exclusion of the middle. Because there are only two choices, if one is wrong somehow, the other is therefore correct. The problem is that there isn't only two choice for sure. Besides, science is wrong all the time, it doesn't prove that creation is right. In fact, for instance, science estaimtes of moon dust have been proven wildly wrong, and those corrections actually harm creation.

fact_870	fact	"Actually, according to your use of the word ""person,"" she is. A significant percentage of fertilized eggs fail to implant and are instead passed. How sad (and typical) that you haven't bothered to educate yourself about these things."
fact_1541	fact	While that may be true of life in general, all it really logically entails is that SOME â not all â organisms throughout all of lifeâs history were able to reproduce. And at a smaller scale, it does not apply to any individual organism: it doesnât tell us that in order for organism X to be considered living that it must reproduce (take for example, mules).   Must All Living Organisms Die?  An implicit assumption in the last several arguments is that all living things must die. After all, if a living organism didnât die, then it wouldnât need to reproduce in order to persist, even for 4 billion years. We need to ask, âDoes this assumption of universal death hold?â Yes, well, at least for all instances of life that we currently know of. Thus, it is a conclusion based on induction, not on necessity.   Consider a species capable of repairing itself indefinitely. Sound far fetched? Well, we humans ourselves are desiring to do just that. And to an extremely limited degree, we have succeeded. Of course, we still have an enormous distance left before fully succeeding, but if we were to eventually do so, then could it really be said that reproduction is a requirement to consider humans as being alive? No. Weâd be like âimmortal mulesâ: weâd be alive, yet incapable of reproducing â¦ but unlike mules, we wouldnât need to be continually replaced by reproduction. After all, we could stop reproducing (women might really like that idea!) and instead focus on repairing those that currently exist.  Perhaps, though, we âimmortal mulesâ, by simply repairing ourselves and maintaining the status quo, would still somehow die: after all, nature shows us that those organisms that donât adapt to the ever changing conditions on Earth just donât last. Perhaps the changes in our environment would be too dramatic to be handled by simply replacing what is damaged with a new part. This line of reasoning fails since our intent is not simply to repair ourselves, but to improve ourselves as well. Humans intend to direct their own bodily evolution, either via installed hardware or through genetic manipulations, adapting our bodies to changes in the environment.   And if we ever reach this ultimate goal (is it a good goal?!), then we could save energy by modifying our bodies to eliminate the no-longer-required processes involved in reproduction .   Conclusion  Based on the above lines of reason, I assert that reproduction is not an absolute requirement of life: that something could be considered to be alive without it necessarily needing to be able to reproduce.

As for three reasons...  1) The state of Florida doesn't believe a 13 yr old can have sex (consent) so why couold she be able to cosent to an abortion?  2) The State is the guardian and they should be able to say where she can and can't go as a parent would be able to do....and the state has a law against taking kids to abortion clinics.  3) ABORTION IS KILLING A KID. Maybe that doesn't matter for most :-/

fact_1557	fact	That's nonsense. When Darwin was at the University of Edinburgh studying medicine, he spent more time studying zoology and geology. His teachers were some of the most respected scientists of the day. Later, when he was at Christ's College, Cambridge studying divinity in preparation entry into the seminary, he actually spent more time studying botany and natural science, under John Henslow (a mineralologist and botanist). Darwin later studied with Adam Sedgwick (a geologist). Both men were leading scientists in their field of the day (both taught at Cambridge). Henslow became a lifelong friend of Darwin and it was his recommendation that gained Darwin the position aboard the Beagle. By the way, both men were ordained in the Chruch of England.

fact_682	fact	But it isn't an assertion of absolute truth. It is actually an assertion of the consensus of current scientific thought. I have read some discussion about various other possibilities. Maybe several forms of life arose in various environments. Eventually they then had to compete for resourses and all but one went extinct. And then there is the hypothesis that life arose more than once and fused into a single population. The bottom line is that the DNA code is universal with only a few minor differences in a limited number of primative organisms.
fact_2062	fact	Actually, there is no such implication. However, there are some things that we might expect if all life is descended from a common ancestor. For one thing, we might expect that the molecule of heredity would be the same across all life. We find that it is DNA. We would expect that the particular codons that encode amino acids would be quite similar for all forms of life. That turns out to be the case, except for minor variations in some primitive forms of life, the DNA code is identical across life. We would expect to see a nested hierarchy of species and we do. We find that house cats are similar to the other 36 species of cat, which are carnivores, which are mammals, which are tetrapods, which are vertebrates, which are chordates. We would expect to find transitional species between major groups of animals, and we do. We find feathered dinosaurs and birds with bony tails and teeth. We find whales with feet. We find reptiles that are very much like mammals, even some with a double jointed jaw that was part of the transition of reptile jaw bones to the inner ear of mammals. We even find mammals that lay eggs.

fact_669	fact	"Well, stated that way, there is no problem with religion and evolution co-existing. Many evolutionary biologists are religious. Dr. Kenneth Miller of Brown U. is a practicing Christian and a respected evolutionary biologist. He engages in debates from time to time with creationists and ID proponents. There is little problem with the theories of evolution and most main-line religions around the world.  The real debate is between a minority of United States fundamentalist christians and science in general. You have seen on this board that even though the theories of evolution are biological, several creationists have insisted that somehow there is a grand theory of evolution that includes the origin of the universe, the galaxies, the solar system, the planets, the earth, and life on earth. Typicaly, creationists claim that they don't oppose science but only evolution - and by that they mean cosmology, astronomy, astrophysics, planetary physics, biochemistry, geology, most of physics (relativity, quantum mechanics, thermodynamics), genetics, molecular biology, population genetics, embryology (evo-devo), paleontology, paleoanthropology, and on and on. What is not opposed is trivial and limited that data upon which scientific theory is built, not the theories.  So to answer the question can religion and evolution co-exist? Without question. Evolutionary scientists do not study matters outside the domain of science. Science is naturalistic - methodological naturalism - and cannot observe and study the supernatural. The supernatural cannot be quantified. I have yet to see an equation that represents the power of God. That is not to claim that things outside of science do not exist or are not valid and important. It is just that science is not the proper tool for the study of such matters. Questions of faith and morals fall in other domains - theology and religion, for example.  Can creationism and science co-exist? Probably not. But the problem is not with science. It is with creationism. Creationism establishes its conclusions before any evidence is examined based on ""divine revelation."" The problem arises when science, without regard to religion, uses the scientific method to arrive at conclusions that cannot be reconciled with creationist conclusions. This makes science the evil work of Satan, and it means that scientists are trying to escape responsibility to a god based on primitive mythology."

fact_655	fact	"Not to rain on anyone's parade:  ""The liberal hysteria about the tea parties and town hall protests, kicked off by the Obama administrationâs issuance of a Homeland Security bulletin warning of right wing terrorists and extremists, has led to a lot of hyperbole on the left about how, well, extreme and terrorist-like the right is becoming. And to be sure, there are some nuts who are politically active on the right who should probably be locked up for their own good. But there are plenty of nuts like that on the left as well.  A Texas woman faces trial this month in Austin on charges she threatened to kill a government informant who infiltrated an Austin-based group that planned to bomb the Republican National Convention in St. Paul, Minn., last fall.  Katyanne Marie Kibby, 25, was indicted in June by a federal grand jury in Austin. She is accused of retaliating against Brandon Darby, the community activist-turned-informant who helped federal prosecutors win convictions against Bradley Neal Crowder, 24, and David Guy McKay, 23.  Prosecutors say the e-mail threat was made Jan. 10. That was two days after Crowder reached a plea bargain with federal prosecutors in Minneapolis for his role in the plot to build Molotov cocktails and attack the GOP convention in September 2008.  Crowder and McKay were part of a group of activists that had gone to the Twin Cities to take part in street demonstrations. The FBI had infiltrated the group with Darby. Crowder and McKay built eight of the gasoline firebombs but didnât use them, a fact law enforcement officials credited to Darby.  Members of the Austin protest community heaped scorn on Darby, saying he had betrayed longtime friends and colleagues.  Kibby, who lives in Houston, is free on bond. If convicted, she could face 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. She could not be reached for comment.  Whatâs funny is that, even as this is going on, the left is all atwitter about some gun owners legally carrying their firearms to tea parties in accordance with their 2nd amendment rights. You hear about that endlessly on news outlets like MSNBC, but Iâll bet Kibbyâs name has never been mentioned on the network. Not to mention Crowderâs name or McKayâs.  As far as Iâm concerned, violence has no place in American politics right now. I firmly believe that we citizens should embrace our 2nd amendment rights as they were enshrined in the Constitution against a day when, as Thomas Jefferson put it, the âtree of libertyâ will need to be replenished once again by the blood of âpatriots and tyrants.â But that time is certainly not now.  And people who plan on firebombing political conventions, or those who beat down peaceful protesters in the streets (Iâm looking at you, SEIU) are tyrants. Not patriots."""

That could mean rape, however, I'm pretty sure that was not Moses's intention.

There is no complete proof for any of the theories, but Evolution just gives more evidence...  And if Creationists just want some credit for their beliefs and work, they shouldn't want evolution to be deleted vom Education. No one knows what is right but right now the theories of Evolution just shows more evidence and is widely accepted and used...

Although the environments are made as close as possible to the natural habitats, penguins are often kept in open-air enclosures in temperate or even tropical climates. And there are two critical differences in even the most carefully constructed zoo: the absence of any predators, and the absence of any prey. So why don't the animals quickly/purposefully/nonrandomly cease exhibiting developmentally costly traits which give them an advantage against predators or prey who aren't present?

I have no doubt that God cares for the lives of fetuses. But I also have no doubt that God cares for the lives of pregnant women.  The reason I brought up the Exodus passage is that it's often taken to establish that abortion is murder, and that performing an abortion should be punished accordingly. But the passage isn't talking about abortion at all. Which just leaves us with the question of when it is or isn't acceptable to take a life, and the passage doesn't provide guidance to that general question, either."

fact_2274	fact	"Oh dear; where do I even start?  Ok, look, the ToE doesn't say that the possibility was ever there for random mutation to suddenly make wings appear out of nowhere. It just doesn't.  The evolution of something as complex as a wing proceeds by a lot of intermediate steps, each one of them being useful, or at least associated with something useful. We don't see humans or dogs or alligators suddenly sprouting wings because that would require massive wholesale genomic, and probably epigenetic, change. What we do see are more mundane, less drastic variations which can accumulate over time.  It's tempting to think ""wings evolving from arms; huh, what about the millions of years when they were neither; how could they have been 'fittest'?"" The mistake there is in visualising a straightforward morph from 'then' to 'now', as if the organism knew where it was headed. A better way to imagine it is via an intermediate stage where the arms were still useful as arms, but also conferred an aerodynamic advantage, such as we see in flying squirrels today. If the original purpose of the arms later becomes less important, those features can atrophy while improved aerodynamic qualities remain strongly selected. The divergence of mice and bats is likely to have followed just such a pattern; who knows, in another ten million years we might see descendents of flying squirrels that are as adept in the air as bats are today.  So in a sense, 'flying squirrels' are your answer. I can't guarantee they'll evolve more and more wing-like structures over the next few million years, but it's possible."

fact_319	fact	"You actually think Evolution works by what creatuers  want ? You think they just got up one day and said, ""ya know Bob, I wanna evolve."" !!Oops, there goes my tail!!  One want an organism can change is due to being in a different environment, isolated from the previous group. Mutations can occur, and if they aren't killer, they are passed on. Changes in genetic material through mutation add to the gene pool and are passed on through mating.  If you are an isolated group of animals, and you have enough mutations and mating, you will change over time. The environment, through one process, can choose who succeeds and who doesn't. It's natural selection. There are other mechanisms, of course, so that's not the only one.  We already know that Human brain development could possible have occured due to a new diet, in a new area. Meat allowed for a larget brain, which in turn allowed for better skills, compared to other animals. Humans used tools as well, which was aided by using hands. Eventually, these animals descended from the trees and ceased to be arboreal creatures, because they needed to use their hands for tools. You can't do that that well if you are swining in a tree."

There may still be a natural substance on which the bacteria survives. It may even be similar to nylon, but it has yet to be discovered. This is a big maybe, though."

For example, the bottom of the Solnhofen lagoon about 140 to 170 million years ago was anoxic. Today, the bottom of the Black Sea is anoxic.  You don't explain why a bone has to be under pressure.

fact_39	fact	No. That's the hypothesis. A theory has been tested. That means that from the hypothesis a prediction is made that has the power to falsify the hypothesis. In other words, the prediction must necessarily be true if the hypothesis is correct. Then an experiment is designed and conducted to test the prediction. When the hypothesis has been tested strongly, it is called a theory.  From the evidence a hypothesis is formulated. The hypothesis is a proposed explanation that takes into account all of the observed facts. It is built on previous science, experience and sometimes guess work. Then comes the prediction, followed by the experiment that tests the prediction. If it passes, you may have a theory.

Natural selection is the differential reproductive success of organisms with more favorable suites of characteristics. It is a statistical tendency.

He never used the phrase ""survival of the fittest"" without also making a reference to natural selection. The opposite is not the case. Since Darwin's time ""survival of the fittest"" has been rejected by evolutionary biologists because it is such a poor representation of the extent of the theory."

Again, your example is not an example of the laws of logic because logic is a concept and cannot be observed. Putting your hand in the fire has everything to do with nerves not logic; saying that A then B does not follow because someone could tie your hand (I know people that will burn themselves) in a fire and then A would not equal B, however the laws of logic cannot be violated.   Logic cannot come from experience because people's experiences change and are different which means that the laws of logic could change. Logic does not come from your mother's teaching because not everyone has a mother and mothers think differently.   Again, if the laws of logic are human constructs then how can they be absolute since humans think differently and often contradictorily. If they are produced from human minds, and human minds are mutually contradictory, then how can the constructs be absolute? Therefore, the laws of logic are not human constructs.

fact_1184	fact	"But it does have an answer, as long as (and I see no reason to infer otherwise) 'organisation' is defined, as are many scientific concepts, as a human-imposed description of the sum of a multitude of physical cause/effect phenomena. Remember when we argued about entropy? I essentially stated (or admitted, if you want to see it that way) that the concepts that we label 'entropy', 'order', 'disorder' and even 'particle' are human-imposed abstracts applied for ease of understanding.   Again referencing a point I have previously made, the maths that backs up the areas of physics (which necessarily includes chemistry/biology) that are confirmed with near-certitude, is equally as-certain-as-possible, but is impossible to satisfactorily translate into ordinary language; hence the terms employed that, relative to the maths, are so vague and easily misinterpretable. My best example is the uncertainty principle, which can be explained in words, but can only be shown to be an uncontrevertible fact by using maths. The great thing about the UP is that it is not even necessary to perform a real experiment; given certain parameters (already known) the UP is inevitable.  The POV I am justifying here is one that does not even begin to reference such terms as 'organisation' and what may 'drive' it. This may be a personal thing, but ideally IMHO the scientific method should never assume 'organisation' or 'drives', it should only look at facts and figures. After this analysis has been done mathematically, there may (and indeed always are) patterns discernible that we, humans, can label 'organisation' and 'drives', but these things do not exist in and of themselves. They are abstracts, simplifications, words used so that we do not have to talk in complex equations.  Given all this, when we come to the Four Fundamental Forces, we do actually know (ie we are almost certain) that these phenomena are a part of the world of facts and figures, not part of the world of human-imposed concepts. My best supporting argument for this is that the FFFs cannot (yet) be further reduced to anything simpler. There are plenty of other 'forces' such as kinetic energy, potential energy etc that derive their very existence from the FFFs. The FFFs are anything but non-material, as they are intermediated by known, defined, observed particles/quanta or in the case of gravity, the medium of spacetime. The only confusion comes when trying to determine ""What is a particle? What is spacetime?"" Regardless of the answers, surely we have to assume that particles and spacetime are material, for if not, then nothing is."

fact_2102	fact	"Sadly, you may be correct. The mindless majority of the American people have been duped to believe that science is somehow opposed to their religion. They know that the mythology of bronze age nomads is historically correct. Don't confuse them with facts - so what if grasshoppers don't have 4 legs, what if rabbits don't chew cud, and who cares it bats are not birds? The Bible is true without error.  Certainly people who have bee indoctrinated to believe that ""GODDIDIT"" will believe that question. They have been taught that it is a sin to question revealed truth, and revealed truth is revealed by ""ministers"" who are scientifically illiterate.  Why does creationism seem to be a matter of the views of those who are becoming rich from the stupidity of the Christins masses.  In the mean time, the U.S. is now a second rate country, where our universities are manned by an increasing number of foreign professors. I don't have a problem with foreign professors except that there are no qualified U.S. citizens out there. It is becoming increasingly apparent that the leadership of U.S. universities is due to the influx of foreign professors. They get paid more here than in their own country, and of course, they are more qualified than U.S. applicants for their positions.  I wonder if our universities will be able to maintain leadership in the world of academia when the entire upper echelon is overtaken by better educated and more qualified foreigners.  In fact: Japan has about half the population of the U.S. and graduates about twice the number of students with degrees in science and engineering.  Isn't it wonderful that we are debating the pseudoscience of creationism and ID in our school boards? It is the beginning of the end."

fact_1386	fact	Yes, of course the past can never be proven.  But there are indirect ways to determine what happened within a reasonable ball park.  We can assume that our solar system formed merely by matter coalescing by gravity and then behaving the way matter behaves when it's all clumped together by gravity. We can model it on a computer and if we get something that looks like our current solar system then we can say that the model is a good one and the chances that the solar system formed that way are increased. No, sorry, there is no proof, only explanations and models.  * - edit: you know, actually, evidence in the form of experimental results are reviewed, or at least the methods are reviewed, and then if the experiment isn't reproducible then the evidence becomes suspect, so in that light evidence is, sort of, reviewed.

fact_721	fact	Sure. I would like to discuss the first one. It shows obvious similarities that are almost certainly not coincidencial.  In part I, the fish and salamander look similar to everything else (note the curvature and the small flaps under the head).  However, in parts II and III, the fish and salamander begin to look different.  You can see where this is leading, right? It is leading to the assertion that these organisms are related, but that the fish and reptiles are not as closely related to the mammals as the mammals are related to each other.  This assertion is also backed up by the fossil record, but that isn't as visible as this picture.
fact_735	fact	Well if there can be a Constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage, why not to remove marrriage from the federal government? Where do they get that power Constitutionally? So that would mean states can choose not to recognize any marriage Constitutionally. I think that marriage is a church issue. Let gays, straights, everyone get civil unions to be recognized legally. But leave marriage to the churches.
fact_734	fact	But what is adultery?  Mark 10:11:  And he saith unto them, Whosoever shall put away his wife, and marry another, committeth adultery against her. And if a woman shall put away her husband, and be married to another, she committeth adultery.  Matthew 19:9:  And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except it be for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth adultery; and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery.   Strange that the gospels differ so importantly about what Jesus said in the same instance. According to Mark, all putting away is adultery, but Matthew says that her fornication provides for an out for him. Which is it?

fact_2117	fact	Many people would allow abortions in extreme cases because they figure that since extreme cases make up about 5% of abortions then if they can get all but extreme cases then they will be saving at least 95%, which is better than nothing. After that they can work towards stopping all abortions. It's a step-by-step process.   I say abortion of all kinds should be illegal. 95% of abortions are a result of consentual sex. We shouldn't cater to the 5% just because they've had a tough situation. I sympathize with them and would do what I could to help them, but they do still need to have the baby, whether they give it up for adoption or not. This isn't a horribly unreasonable position. It's just a difficult position. Saying it's alright to kill a baby for any reason is a horribly unreasonable position.  People need to face the facts too. Sex isn't there for pleasure, it's there for procreation and happens to be pleasureable. Someone who indulges in this pleasure should be ready to deal with the outcome, which oftentimes is a baby.

The indian citizens were never actually disarmed under British rule, just the army. During WWI, indians were allowed to volunteer for the British army (the British knew it was a bad idea to conscript men from colonies).

fact_10	fact	"This is a statement written by someone who obviously has not read scripture. One of the most astonising ""proofs"" if you will, that the Bible is of supernatural origin, is predictive prophecy. Science cannot, as you claim, ""explain"" everything, and it has no natural explanation for the   predictions made in scripture. How can science explain through statistical probablity the over 600 prophecies in Biblical writings that have come to pass? Also, how can it explain how supposedly uneducated people (uneducated in the ways of modern science) wrote about astronomy as if they knew about the universe as we do today. How could they have described the hydrological cycle as we have only come to know it recently?Ecclesiastes 1:6  The wind goes toward the south,  And turns around to the north;  The wind whirls about continually,  And comes again on its circuit.    How did they know that the earth ""hangs on nothing"" when the accepted norm of the day did not even accept that possibility?  Job 26:7  He stretches out the north over empty space;  He hangs the earth on nothing.    How did they know that the ""vapors"" of the earth rise to create moisture, that is seeded by lightning with nitrogen and then falls as rain to fertilze the soil?  Jeremiah 10:13  When He utters His voice,  There is a multitude of waters in the heavens:  âAnd He causes the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth.  He makes lightning for the rain,  He brings the wind out of His treasuries.â    Hydrothermal vents[4] are described in two books of the Bible written before 1400BCâmore than 3,000 years before their discovery by science.  Genesis 7:11  In the six hundredth year of Noahâs life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, on that day all the fountains of the great deep were broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.    Even though the Bible is not a scientific text book and doesn't purport to be, nowhere is it scientifically inaccurate. In addition, many of the scientific ideas you are so impressed with are nothing new to the Bible. It was speaking of these things long before modern science spoke of them.  The story goes ""They (scientists) are slowly working their way to the mountain's peak painstakingly measuring and analyzing every step that they take. After many years of research, they finally arrive at the top of the mountain, scale over its leading edge, only to find a group of theologians sitting there with the answers all along."""

Back about 5 years ago, they had a family member come out and say that they testified wrongly against them. Second, the whole idea of the Russian threat was some paronoid fantasy by this one guy named McCarthy who was an idiot and a big fraidy cat. Because of his loonicy, too many people lost jobs wrongfully (and lives) and made an entire nation of scared citizens even more frightened.  Besides, the Russians were never really a threat to us in the first place. They were more of a threat to themselves.
fact_324	fact	"First of all, let's compare the ""B"" specimen in this fossil link to the modern specimen and point out any significant difference to me. Secondly, shortly after the discovery was made of the living fish, but before the fix was in to excuse the massive assumptions evolutionists previously made regarding what the fossil represented, Nat Geo reported the truth about the claims evolutions had made prior to finding this fish alive and well and basically unchanged after an alleged hundreds of millions of years.  One example that amply demonstrates the accuracy of evolutionary dating and sequencing of fossil fish, or any fossil for that matter, would be the story of the coelacanth. This is a genuine fish story. For many years evolutionists had assured us that the coelacanth, a member of the crossopterygian family and a supposed link to amphibians, had most definitely been extinct for at least sixty million years, at least according to their precise methods of dating and their exact analysis of the indisputable evidence of the fossil record. No doubt about it, the coelacanth died out millennia ago along with the dinosaurs, at least until a living coelacanth was dredged up off the coast of Africa in 1938.  Since then hundreds of live coelacanths have been found. In the June, 1988 National Geographic Magazine they featured numerous pictures of the coelacanth swimming around in the ocean depths, where they differ very little from the ones found entombed in the fossil layers, thus providing no evidence of any kind of evolution occurring for the coelacanth, despite the fact that the evolutionists say these fish have been swimming around for at least four hundred million years.  The ancient coelacanths, from the first time they appeared in the fossil record were virtually identical to the living ones we find at the present day, extending all the way back through the geologic record past the Paleogene age of the mammals (63 million years), before the Cretaceous and Jurassic age of the dinosaurs (100 million through 225 million years ago), before the Triassic age of early mammals (200 million through 250 million years ago), before the Permian age of early reptiles (250 million through 300 million years ago), before the Carboniferous age (300 million through 370 million years ago), all the way back to the Devonian era, 400 million years ago in the fossil record, according to the time scale of the evolutionists.  Initially it couldn't be admitted that a living coelacanth had appeared that was identical to a species that evolutionists had calmly assured us was extinct for so many millions of years.  Thus when a live example of this extinct fish had been found, J.L.B. Smith, a chemist and ichthyologist at Rhodes University in Grahamstown University, South Africa, pronounced it an entirely new genus and species, differentfrom any coelacanth previously recorded as fossils. Smith gave the living coelacanth a very scientific name, Latimeria chalumnae, after Marjorie Courtenay-Latimer who discovered the fish, and the mouth of the Chalumna River where it was captured.  Just how different is this fish from the ancient coelacanth? On pp.832 of the National Geographic article of 1988, there is a study of the comparative anatomy between the living and ancient coelacanth with this caption next to pictures of each one. They state: ""LIKE CARBON COPIES, the tail of a live coelacanth and a 140-million year-old fossil virtually match.""  They go on to report: ""Few creatures have endured such an immense span of time with so little change as the coelacanth. The cut-away drawing of a present-day specimen seems almost identical with the 140-million year-old fossil found in a quarry in southern West Germany. It is that extraordinary lack of change that enabled Professor J.L.B. Smith in Grahamstown to identify the coelacanth caught in South Africa in 1938 from a rough sketch, although he had never seen a live specimen.""(30)  Throughout the entire history of vertebrate animals the coelacanth appears, differing very little in structure, showing absolutely no signs of evolving from one species and/or changing into any other kind of species through the supposed millions of years of it's existence. It would seem that giving the newly discovered living coelacanth the status of an entirely new species and genus was simply to hide their embarrassment while they were scrambling to come up with some kind of an explanation as to why they had been so sure that it had been extinct for sixty million years. I think there's something fishy here in what the evolutionists have been trying to tell us. This is true of virtually all fossils found, whether sharks or sand-dollars, they show no signs of evolutionary change to or from another distinct species.  Evolutionists had long speculated that the crossopterygians (the class of fish including the coelacanth), because they had bony elements in their fins, may have had the ability to walk while in the water on the floor of the sea, which somehow led to the development of legs to walk on the land.  This scenario was put to rest when the authors wrote in the National Geographic article: ""Our films settled another question that has intrigued scientists: whether the coelacanth can walk on its lobed fins. Though we observed several individuals resting with their fins braced against the sea bottom, we never saw any of them walk, and it appears the fish is unable to do so.""(31)  It should be noted that the coelacanth does not lay eggs like most fish, amphibians and reptiles do, but gives live birth. Thus as evolutionists had tried to connect the coelacanth with some unknown link between amphibians and fish, this would put it in a rather dubious position as an intermediary candidate. The red-tailed sun perch off the northwest coast of the United States also gives live birth after nine months, two thirds of all existing sharks give birth to live, wriggling, little, sharks, some lizards give live birth, so a supposed evolutionary sequence demonstrating how fish, amphibians and reptiles lay eggs while only mammals and marsupials give live birth would be in serious trouble.  The Fossil Record  Here's the relevant point of exposing how evolutionists dealt with defining the Coelacanth. Before evolutionists knew that living examples of this fish existed, they never even hesitated in taking the observable physical features it exhibited and thought nothing of creating a completely inaccurate and totally fictional biography of that fish's evolutionary journey. They not only claimed that it crawled on the Sea bottom which proved it was an intermediary fish, but they made assumptions based on the fact that it birthed its young live rather than being an egg layer.  Here is Hans Fricke's own story regarding the investigation into the coelacanths natural habitat which Nat Geo's story is based upon. And notice the last paragraph in the story. The Fish That Time Forgot - Sidebar - MSN Encarta IT SAY'S THIS:  I confess I'm sorry we never saw a coelacanth walk on its fins. Professor Smith himself nicknamed the coelacanth Old Fourlegs in the belief that the creature actually did walk upon the seafloor like a seal on its flippers. Alas, that does not seem to be the case. For every myth we dispelled, however, I'm certain there are a dozen fascinating discoveries still to be made. In short, we have just begun to know the coelacanth.  So even though this man is in no way an anti-evolutionist, even he had to admit that what had been not only assumed to be true about the coelacanth, but had been widely reported as a discovery which was supported by documented fossil evidence, was a complete myth. Which I believe and assert can be said for all of the so called evidence which exists for the pseudo science of evolution."

The Earth is very able to repair itself in spite of modern mans sense of self importance. Here's some interesting photographic evidence of it. www.pbase.com/andrys/noah
fact_1230	fact	"Oh really, what specific rulings by the 1st, 3rd, and 10th circuit courts are you referring to? I've read the rulings by the 1st, 3rd, and 10 circuits courts on the matter and I don't understand what you're talking about.   ""Appellant, Peter B. Thomas, argues that the City of Portland, Maine, and various city officials infringed his constitutional rights by denying him a permit to carry a concealed handgun. Established case law makes clear that the federal Constitution grants appellant no right to carry a concealed handgun. See, e.g., United States v. Miller, 307 U.S. 174, 178, 59 S.Ct. 816, 818, 83 L.Ed. 1206 (1939) (second amendment applies only to weapons that have a 'reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia.')""  Thomas v. Members of City Council of Portland (1st Cir. 1984)   ""Appellant Raymond Rybar, Jr. was convicted following a conditional guilty plea to two counts of violating 18 U.S.C. Section(s) 922(o), which makes it 'unlawful for any person to transfer or possess a machine gun.' On appeal, he argues that the district court erred in rejecting his challenge to that provision as beyond Congress' commerce power and as violating the Second Amendment. Neither challenge is persuasive....In support, Rybar cites, paradoxically, the Supreme Court decision in United States v. Miller, 307 U.S. 174 (1939), where the Court upheld the constitutionality of a firearms-registration requirement against a Second Amendment challenge. Rybar draws on that holding, relying on the Miller Court's observation that the sawed-off shotgun in question had not been shown to bear 'some reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia.' Brief of Appellant at 24-25; Miller, 307 U.S. at 178. Drawing from that language the contra positive implication, Rybar suggests that because the military utility of the machine guns proscribed by Section(s) 922(o) is clear, a result contrary to that reached in Miller is required, and the statute is therefore invalid under the Second Amendment....We note first that however clear the Court's suggestion that the firearm before it lacked the necessary military character, it did not state that such character alone would be sufficient to secure Second Amendment protection. In fact, the Miller Court assigned no special importance to the character of the weapon itself, but instead demanded a reasonable relationship between its 'possession or use' and militia related activity....Rybar's invocation of this statute does nothing to establish that his firearm possession bears a reasonable relationship to 'the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia,' as required in Miller, 307 U.S. at 178. ""  U.S. v. Rybar (3rd. Cir. 1996)   ""the courts consistently have found no conflict between federal gun laws and the Second Amendment, narrowly construing the latter to guarantee the right to bear arms as a member of a militia....""   United States v. Graves (3rd Cir. 1977)   ""The purpose of the second amendment as stated by the Supreme Court in United States v. Miller, supra at 178, 59 S.Ct. 816, was to preserve the effectiveness and assure the continuation of the state militia.""  United States v. Oakes (10th Cir. 1977)"
fact_867	fact	Actually, monkeys do not change into humans. The ancestor of all primates had the potential to become many different things. If a primate were to change (somehow), it probably would not become human.  By the way, such a change will not be shown within your lifetime. Aren't you aware of the thousands of years involved?
fact_1556	fact	Actually the bible really barely comments. Look how short and jumbled the Genesis account is. Genesis did not even fit what humans knew when it was written. So matching any creation theory to genesis is impossible. Unless you believe God created the heaven and earth twice, and created animals twice. Sure you can explain it away, but a verbal reading of the ACTUAL TEXT will make your head swim.   I donât wana be sacrilegious, but some parts of Genesis makes God look like he was telling a fish story to a really dumb scribe too lazy to get on his camel and go to the library of Alexandria , or worse one of his interns. I am a irrational creationist btw.
fact_873	fact	Walking-fish:  A great example of this is the way Young Earthers try to discount radiometric dating. They will choose a couple hundred inconsistent radiometric dates out of the thousands that have been recorded and argue that they are unreliable. Then they will choose a couple lame pieces of evidence for a young earth, such as Robt Gentry's Polonium halos, rate of decay in the earth's magnetic field, rates of sediment/salt deposition in the ocean or rate of population growth. This is supposed to outweigh the evidence from thousands of good radiometric dates. Creationists are not very good at doing science but they are good at picking cherries. So if you own an orchard and need a few good field hands, hire a young earth creationist.
fact_1542	fact	"It is the same as you saying ""you can't know anything of the unknowable"""
fact_1224	fact	"Yes. But that means that the cat ""kind"", a single pair, produced 4 genera with 36 species in, at most, a couple hundred years. And that doesn't even include domestic cats. It makes the head of any evolutionary biologist spin! Creationists who wish to deny evolution invoke hyperevolution for thousands of ""kinds"" to yield millions of species in hundreds of years. And yet, they deny evolution."

fact_1519	fact	"Well this doesn't answer my question though. With this bill, where is the money coming from? Are we cutting doctors jobs? I hate to use a Krugman thing but this looks like an ""underpants gnomes"" theory.  1) Pass Senate Bill  2) ???????  3) Save $3,000 per capita."
fact_2010	fact	"But the point is that the Razor should not be used to test hypotheses! That isn't what Ockham stated the Razor as. The whole point is that you can't use this warped version of the Razor for hypothesis testing. In the example, impetus was a hypothesis for a cause for movement. Ockham eliminated the hypothesis as a description of the phenonmenon.  The Razor states that the animal was struck. Period. From that observations you make hypotheses as to what struck the animal. Hi_Its_Me listed only 2 of the possible hypotheses. Then, without testing either hyopothesis, he eliminated one as ""unlikely"" and used ""unlikely"" to = false. But there was not testing. Yet testing is not only possible but easy. Last year my daughter's car hit a deer. The deer's carcass wasn't found but it would have had pieces of glass embedded in it. Testing those pieces would show that they came from the windshield of a Pontiac Sunfire. That eliminates the alien spaceship hypothesis. (Unless you propose the ad hoc hypothesis that the spaceship coincidentally had glass identical to that of a Pontiace Sunfire. However, that ad hoc hypothesis can't be independently tested and is therefore invalid)."
fact_196	fact	So what are some examples of restrictive gun laws in South Africa? The people in South Africa think their gun laws are not strict enough.   In one of your previous posts you seem determined to use South Africa as evidence that outlawing guns doesn't work. But gun ownership is still legal there.
fact_182	fact	"So tell me....knowing that the human race is 99.9% the same, and that ""No matter how scientists today scrutinize a person's genes, they can't determine with certainty whether an individual is from one ""racial"" group or another""....how can you justify how the racist scientists can hold up a skull and make judgements about it? How could they possibly construct a human phylogenetic tree if traits are modified by enviornment, not dictated by randomly mutating genes? How can the pigs in science proclaim that Neandethals were a different ""species"" based not on their genes -- which are 99.9% similar as ours -- but their receding chin and large skull? Evolutionary science is full of nothing but good-for-nothing, monkey-loving, chance-worshipping, racist fools."
fact_2004	fact	"Well then, my skeptic fellow Australians, what is the answer to the question? Do any of you guys here know? I sure as hell don't. Creationists did not misquote Dawkins because the words came from his mouth. And Dawkins is a professional at biology, but he could not answer such a question.  In the little amount of fossils that we do see, they are not evolutionary. There is no clear cut fossils showing the evolution of man, is there. By ""true human"" I mean they were just like us, just varients of human kind that we have today - looked human, walked like us, most likely were quite intelligent. I have got to go to school, continue this later."

fact_1243	fact	"""4 JUSTICE STEVENS criticizes us for discussing the prologue last. Post,  at 8. But if a prologue can be used only to clarify an ambiguous operative  provision, surely the first step must be to determine whether the  operative provision is ambiguous. It might be argued, we suppose, that  the prologue itself should be one of the factors that go into the determination  of whether the operative provision is ambiguousâbut that  would cause the prologue to be used to produce ambiguity rather than  just to resolve it. In any event, even if we considered the prologue  along with the operative provision we would reach the same result we  do today, since (as we explain) our interpretation of âthe right of the  people to keep and bear armsâ furthers the purpose of an effective  militia no less than (indeed, more than) the dissentâs interpretation.  See infra, at 26â27.  5 JUSTICE STEVENS is of course correct, post, at 10, that the right to  assemble cannot be exercised alone, but it is still an individual right,  and not one conditioned upon membership in some defined âassembly,â  as he contends the right to bear arms is conditioned upon membership in a defined militia. And JUSTICE STEVENS is dead wrong to think that  the right to petition is âprimarily collective in nature.â Ibid. See  McDonald v. Smith, 472 U. S. 479, 482â484 (1985) (describing historical  origins of right to petition).""  DC v. Heller  Pages 8 and 9"

fact_800	fact	His point was criticism of people managing the numbers of their population with abortion. It also addresses the intentional overpopulation for the purpose of overwhelming declining populations.
fact_1531	fact	Nope. No contradiction from Old to New.  Deut 20: 1 When you go out to battle against your enemies, and see horses and chariots, a people more than you, you shall not be afraid of them. For Jehovah your God is with you, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt. 2 And it shall be, when you draw near to battle, the priest shall come and speak to the people, 3 and say to them. Hear, Israel, you are drawing near today to battle against your enemies. Do not let your heart be faint; do not fear nor tremble, nor be terrified before their faces. 4 For Jehovah your God is He who is going before you, to fight for you with your enemies, to save you. 5 And the officers shall speak to the people, saying, who is the man that has built a new house, and has not dedicated it? Let him go and return to his house, that he not die in battle and another man dedicate it. 6 And who is the man that has planted a vineyard, and has not used its fruit? Let him go and return to his house, that he not die in battle, and another man use its fruit. 7 And who is the man who has betrothed a woman, and has not taken her? Let him go and return to his house, that he not die in the battle, and another man take her. 8 And the officers shall speak further to the people, and say, Who is the man who is afraid, and faint of heart? Let him go and return to his house; then the heart of his brothers will not melt like his heart. 9 And it shall be, when the officers have finished speaking to the people, commanders of the armies shall be appointed at the head of the people.  10 When you come near a city to fight against it, then call to it for peace. 11 And it shall be, if it answers peace to you, and shall open to you, then it shall be that all the people found in it shall be forced laborers for you, and shall serve you. 12 And if it shall not make peace with you, and shall make war with you, then you shall lay siege against it. 13 And Jehovah your God shall give it into your hand; and you shall strike every male of it by the mouth of the sword. 14 Only, the women, and the little ones, and the livestock, and all in the city, all its plunder, you shall seize for yourself. And you shall eat the plunder of your enemies which Jehovah your God has given to you. 15 So you shall do to all the cities very far away from you, which are not of the cities of these nations. 16 But of the cities of these peoples which Jehovah your God is giving to you as an inheritance, you shall not keep alive any that breathes. 17 But you shall utterly destroy them the Hittites, and the Amorites, the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, as Jehovah your God has commanded you; 18 so that they may not teach you to do according to all their filthy deeds which they have done for their gods; and you would sin against Jehovah your God. 19 When you shall lay siege to a city many days, to fight against it, to capture it, you shall not destroy its trees in order to force an axe against them. For you shall eat of them, and you shall not cut them down, for is the tree of the field a man that it should be used by you to lay siege? 20 Only the tree which you know not to be a fruit tree, you may destroy it, and may cut it down, and may build a bulwark against the city making war with you, until you have subdued it.

fact_627	fact	First of all, it's not pro evo, it's pro evidence. But I guess that is kinda the same, as all the evidence points to evolution. Second, evolution's not a lie, it is supported by the evidence. Third evolution says nothing about god.  But alright, I'll make you a compromise, refute the list on this forum then.

fact_2212	fact	"First, you wouldn't use a handgun against an F-16 fighter plane. It's stupid and useless, but there are a lot of ingenious people out there that can probably prop up something to shoot one down, that's for sure. The second amendment is about self defense regardless of how big or small the threat is. I would think you would appreciate the ban on machine guns, since they are acknowledging that there is line to draw when it comes to it (like you can't own a fighter jet with military armament and just like the 1st Amendment you can't yell fire in a crowd.) Isn't this what most ""living document"" people say? Oh, I get it now? It's not about that is it? The fact of the matter is, you are dissatisfied that the line wasn't drawn to limit even more of it, i.e. a complete ban on firearms, only the national guard or armed forces should have them. Sorry, but if you were to do that, it would open up another can of worms in which would mean that all other confirmed rights could be limited even more. The SCOTUS did the right thing in this instance because they acknowledged there is a line to be drawn, but not the one that prohibits all law abiding citizens from owning firearm."
fact_2206	fact	Well then this doesn't answer my question.  If you have 10 doctors for 100 people (this is just an example) and only 50 of them have health insurance and each doctor gets paid $100 a year then your health care per capita is $10 ([10doctors x $100]/100 people). If you change it to 100 people with health insurance you now have $10 per capita as well because you population did not change. Health care costs are shown per capita and not per person insured: Per Capita Health Expenditures by Country, 2007 &mdash; Infoplease.com  So again, if you go from $6,000 per capita per that website given above to say Switzerland levels at $4,100 per capita then where did that money come from?

fact_1055	fact	My point is the embryo and zygote have potential to think. Their brain activity (none) is completely normal for their stage of development. Infants donât know much, but their brain activity is normal for their age. It doesnât make them less of a human because they think less.

fact_1914	fact	No, but it does develop very late on, and most abortions are carried out early. Over 99% is pretty high, considering abortions carried out very late tend to be because of problems medically with the mother or the foetus where an abortion is the best option.

fact_1082	fact	"you based this (and other claims) on a summary of the biomorphs program at website that either a) didn't also provide dawkins limitations on the program or b) had the limitations and you didn't bother to relay this information to the forum. You then make incredulous statements about how unrealistic the biomorphs are.   any quotations of web pages are irrelevant because they do not address the basic issue that you are suggesting dawkins puts the biomorphs forth as a model of evolution and natural selection. This is not true as i have quoted part of his book that puts limitations on the biomorphs program, and draws attention to what ""morals"" should be drawn out of the biomorphs."
fact_1928	fact	Well, I have heard people on the pro-gun side say that most defensive gun uses don't involve firing even one round. So limiting the capacity would probably have less of an effect on the ability to defend yourself than on crime. So why are people from the gun lobby always whining about restrictions like this? When semi-automatic rifles were banned in Australia, hunters welcomed the law. They saw it as a challenge because it takes greater skill to shoot an animal with a bolt action rifle. Not so in America where some gun owners like to use guns that could take down planes to shoot small animals.

fact_1096	fact	And that is why there is no plutonium found in the natural (fossil) fission reactors discovered in Oklo, Gabon in Africa.  A fission reaction in the presence of U-238 always produces plutonium. In fact, about 1/3 of the energy output from a typical reactor in the U.S. comes from the fission of plutonium-239 that is created by the fission of U-235. When there is not enough fissionable material left in the fuel to sustain a reaction, there always remains several isotopes of plutonium that were not present in the original enriched uranium fuel.
fact_1109	fact	very smart answer. I never knew men couldnt get pregnant. lol, you just made yourself look like an idiot with that statement. by the way, i was referring to those issues are pretty much symptoms of obesity. But the thing is... obesity isnt natural, the process of pregnancy is totally natural.
fact_2400	fact	To clarify: is it the womans choice whether the guy is prosecuted after he has been named, or is it the states? By what you've said so far, it seems that all this law does is give woman the power to punish men if they get pregnant by them; despite the fact that the woman was just as consenting as the man at the time of the coitus.  There are also contraceptive paths for women that don't involve condoms. If a woman gets pregnant because she forgot to take the pill that morning and always relied on that rather than on condoms to stop her getting pregnant, why should the man be punished?  The message here should be simple. If you don't want an abortion, and aren't currently in a position where you can support your children, don't have unprotected sex. At the moment, it is the woman's choice alone whether she has an abortion or not, so it is the woman who has to look after the child if she is single after its birth. If you want to add men to that equation, you have to add them in both places - give them the legal right to 'have an abortion' (force their partner to have one), and make them legally responsible for the child if they do not do so. Then you have an entirely connected couple from coitus onwards; both consenting to sex, both choosing not to have an abortion and both caring for the child after birth. I doubt that that law would be a popular one, either - but if you are going to force a man to take equal legal responsibility for a child, you have to give them equal legal opportunity to avoid it.

fact_63	fact	"Well, I thought I did. Perhaps you didn't understand.  We can look at the rings of a tree to determine how old it is. We can also determine other things, such as relative lengths of growing seasons and times of catastrophies. If I were to cut down a tree just after it was ""created,"" I would be able to infer a growth pattern and relative seasonal information.. even though there was no growth pattern and there were no seasons.  In the same way, if we look at a star that is 10 billion light years away, we are seeing the events that happened at that star 10 billion years ago.  If this creationist ""response"" is correct, and the light we see didn't originate 10 billion years ago, what is the light telling us? It's telling us a story of stellar events that never happened. That's like writing a history book about events that never took place... Or at the very least, that would be like someone reading my daily journal of the events that took place in my life millions of years before I was born.  Unless you can explain why we would see this false information, this response leaves you stuck with a trickster God.  Moreover, true to SkepticGunt's word, this view is unscientific because it is completely unfalsifiable. ""Because that's how God made it"" is not a scientific claim."
fact_2414	fact	Actually, most people do not hold the view that existing marriages should be dissolved. In Massachussetts, it's quite a minority view, almost as low as Bush's approval rating.  In any case, that is irrelevant. I was pointing out why someone might reasonably ask the question you consider so inappropriate. What I haven't seen, either from you or from any of the articles, was what the firefighter's answer was or why he refused to answer. From what I can tell from the scant coverage, he avoided answering but had no trouble discussing his political views. Odd, I think.. or just crappy coverage.
fact_1135	fact	Gun Registration
fact_1653	fact	No. Evolution is a scientific study of the evidence of how life changes. Evolutionary theory offers falsifiable explanations of how that works. Creationism is religious in that it is based on no evidence. It is based on mythology.
fact_1647	fact	"Actually, the Mormon seminaries aren't ""on the grounds,"" although they may be on an adjacent, privately owned piece of property. It would be unconstitutional for the seminaries to be on property owned by the school district. The children go to the seminary on released-time, which has been found to be constitutional (although I don't see how).  Pertinent decisions about religious instruction and schools are:  McCollum v. Board of Education (333 U.S. 203)  Zorach v. Clauson (343 U.S. 306)  McCollum found that religious instruction on school property is unconstitutional, while Zorach found that ""accommodating"" religious instruction by releasing students from school for that purpose was not."
fact_1121	fact	Because it's all quite clear. Decades of effort from the religious right, conservative republicans, and their like have made gay rights a poisoned topic. It's a tragedy, but saying the right thing on this issue will cost you more votes than it will gain you, everyone knows it, and no one is going to do it. It's politics 101. The democrats, as a whole, want to do the right thing, but they know that if they say so too loudly they won't be in a position to do anything. They're forced to moderate their public stances so that they can get into positions where they can actually take action.   This is of course a generalization, but if you're talking about a political party as a whole that's unavoidable. Generally speaking dems don't trumpet gay rights because they know how many votes it'll cost them, and thus prevent them from actually working for gays rights. Reps don't trumpet gay right because they don't support gay rights. This is the common political wisdom, and if you want to show that it doesn't apply to a specific individual you need to make the case for that individual.
fact_223	fact	Held:   1. The Second Amendment protects an individual right to possess a   firearm unconnected with service in a militia, and to use that arm for   traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the home.   Pp. 2-53.   --Page 1 of the Heller rulin
fact_545	fact	On the contrary, there is no evidence to suggest that we have not evolved via common descent. Not in any living creature thus far examined, or any fossil thus far unearthed.

You talk about ""increased risk of cancer, increased risk of hemmoraging from botched abortions, depression, suicide, post-abortion trauma syndrome"" but these are measured against women who are not pregnant. While an abortion (like any medical proceedure) carries risks, these are far smaller than those posed by a woman who sees a pregnancy to term and gives birth.  In case you forgot, here are the figures I quoted you before:  http://www.acog.org/from_home/public...v103n4p729.pdf  Which shows an abortion will cause 0.3 deaths per 100,000 carried out in the USA in 1995.  http://www.childinfo.org/eddb/mat_mortal/  Which shows a term pregnancy poses a 1 in 4085 risk of death over a womans lifetime in industrialised nations in 1995.  You do the math- how many abortions does a woman need to have before she is as at much risk as that posed by taking pregnacies to term over her lifetime? Something like 80, which gives a good indication of the relative risk......"

Now, what I'd like to hear you describe is exactly how intelligent design works in action:   1) How long does intelligent design take, x years or is it instantaneous?  2) By what mechanism does the designer interact with the natural world?  3) When and why does the designer choose to interact with the world?  4) Why has the vast majority of intelligently designed life ceased to exist? if it was designed correctly in the first place why was it necessary to discard so many forms and replace them with different ones, as evidenced by the fossil record?  5) What experiments have been conducted to verify the occurence of intelligent design?  I'm most interested to hear your ideas on these points.

We see a computer program, we know it needs a programmer. In a similar way, we see the highly complex DNA system, we must reason, coming to a similar conclusion that it needs a Designer.

fact_753	fact	So, you consider a so called theory which allows a 10 billion year gap out of an alleged potential 10 to 20 billion year age for the occurrence to be the most credible theory? And is actually supported by evidence? If they have any evidence, why the 10 billion year gap for wiggle room? No wonder you accept evolution as a rational possibility. The fact is, they have no credible evidence at all as the big bang is nothing more than a deduction based on theoretical mathematical equations which can neither be confirmed or verified.   Just read the link and consider the factors cosmologists must consider before even doing the math required to come up with an age. Now consider how skewed the outcome must be if they are incorrectly interpreting even one aspect of the info they are relying on for the equations which result in an age.  Any errors in those results and the out equations are useless. Thus, the 10 billion year gap in their cosmological guessing game.  How Old is the Universe?  Now consider the creator of the big bang theory itself. Edwin Hubble proposed the big bang as a possible beginning of the Universe based on the perceived expansion of the universe from a tiny central singularity back in 1929. Since then it has become the holy grail of the scientific community in explaining how Time and Space began. http://www.umich.edu/~gs265/bigbang.htm  This theory is made up of nothing more than the imaginings of a young cosmologist back in 1929 yet has been adopted as a rational theory by the scientific community as if they are a bunch of lemmings who will grasp at any explanation which doesn't claim that God did it.

It seems to me that you have an anti-gun agenda and will use any flaw in the system as an excuse to ban all guns for all people. Is that a fair assessment of where you stand?

Jesus contradicted the Old Testament.  The Bible is the inspired word of God, not a dictation to scribes. Men wrote the allegories describing the creation of things.  Saying that mankind took a long time to understand certain things is not limiting the power of God. He could have chosen to make early man Einsteinian, but He didn't. He could have chosen for mankind to bypass the flat-earth concept, but He didn't. He could have chosen for all humans to be highly intelligent, but He didn't. What He did was to leave us alone and let us figure things out on our own, including how long it took to get where we are now."

Pleistocene fossils, including invertebrates, fish, and birds, as well as the large extinct mammals, continue to be found in Pleistocene deposits throughout Utah.

fact_2159	fact	I'd be happy to. The concept that I was trying to move forward was: the idea that - when we see a cecal valve develop, for example, we assume that it is newly engineered data to react to the new environment. Big question mark!  My point is that - the lizard was designed to survive in a neighborhood where eating leaves, was its best chance of survival. So that if a cecal valve became necessary the lizard was ready to go. Having the built-in redundancy makes this possible without missing a beat.

fact_5	fact	Actually, the fossil record does support it. Both Eldredge and Gould have discussed it. Both men made observations of slow gradual speciation in the fossil record in a small geographical area. These changes were reflected at other locations as an abrupt change from one species to another. But given that such changes take place very quickly in populations that are usually under environmental stress and isolated from the main population, and given the rarity of fossilization in the first place, we don't expect to find many examples in the fossil record. It is a bit like trying to time a 100 yd. dash with a sundial. The fossil record just isn't fine grained enough to see the rapid (50-60 thousand years) changes.

fact_2401	fact	Yet again, ignoring the point of the article. Are you not familiar with the Grants' work?  This is only one of several examples of quite rapid evolution that has been observed by the Grants on Daphne Major over what must now be about 30 years.  Here's the situation. Essentially, there are two food sources from two different plants for the finches on Daphne Major. One is a small seed - easily cracked. The other is a large hard shelled seed. At one time, during a drought, the Grants observed that some native finches, Geospiza fortis, evolved larger beaks that enabled them to eat the larger, hard shelled seeds. In other words, the bell curve was extended at the large bill size end. The article (and I presume the paper published by the Grants) recounts the colonization of Daphne Major by a larger ground finch, G. magnirostris, with a correspondingly larger bill. The point is that large G. fortis and small G. magnirostris are similar in size, having similar beak size. As a result, they directly competed for scarce resources. As a result, large beaked G. fortis and small beaked G. magnirostris were at a reproductive disadvantage. As a result, the smaller beaked G. fortis evolved to specialize in the smaller, more easily cracked seeds that G. magnirostris had difficulty in picking up, while G. magnirostris evolved to specialize in the larger, hard shelled seeds.  Anyone interested should read Weiner, Jonathan. The Beak Of The Finch. 1994. Vantage Books, New York. It won a Pulitzer Prize and is the story of the Grants' research on Daphne Major.

How about the actual scientists who reject the media promotion of this issue? Here's an excerpt:  Climatologists Reject Media Claims of Global Warming Consensus  ""[I]n November 2004, German climatologist Hans von Storch, director of the GKSS Institute for Coastal Research (IfK) in Geesthacht, Germany, foresaw that claims of alarmist consensus would be made by nonscientists ...""  Environment & Climate News > August 2005  Environment   Environment > Climate: Consensus   Email a Friend  Written By: Alan Caruba  Published In: Environment & Climate News > August 2005  Publication date: 08/01/2005  Publisher: The Heartland Institute  Leading climatologists spent the month of June fighting false proclamations from non-scientists claiming scientists have reached agreement that catastrophic global warming is occurring.  Alarmists Claim Debate Over  On June 1, California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger (R) claimed ""the debate is over"" and global warming alarmists' predictions had carried the day.  The Natural Resources Defense Council on June 9 declared, ""The world's leading scientists now agree that global warming is real and is happening right now. According to their forecasts, extreme changes in climate could produce a future in which erratic and chaotic weather, melting ice caps and rising sea levels usher in an era of drought, crop failure, famine, flood and mass extinctions.""  On June 13, USA Today declared, ""The debate's over: Globe is Warming."" In support of its claim, the newspaper cited the positions of some left-leaning religious groups, some corporations who will reap a financial windfall from a switch to alternative fuel sources, and some politicians.  Scientists Disagree  While each of the above claims from non-scientists received significant media coverage, leading climatologists spent the month of June rebutting such proclamations.  Atmospheric physicist S. Fred Singer, professor emeritus of environmental sciences at the University of Virginia and former director of the U.S. Weather Satellite Service, sent a letter to the editor of USA Today directly refuting its claim. ""Your editorial ... claim[s] the global warming debate is over. Not so,"" wrote Singer.  Singer wrote, ""Sea level will continue to rise by only seven inches per century as it has for thousands of years no matter what we do or what the EPA [U.S. Environmental Protection Agency] says. And temperatures in the next 100 years will likely rise by less than one degree F--not exactly a catastrophe.""  Added Singer in a subsequent letter to the Canadian media, ""Thousands of scientists from many countries now fully understand that Kyoto and other efforts to control human emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) are ineffective and entirely unfounded scientifically.  ""Even if you ignore the enormous cost of Kyoto (estimated recently by Prof. George Taylor of Oregon State University--see http://www.sitewave.net/news/s49p628.htm--at one trillion U.S. dollars a year for full implementation in OECD countries), climate science research is rapidly moving AWAY from the hypothesis that the human release of greenhouse gases, specifically CO2, is in any way significantly contributing to global climate change.""  Sun Called Primary Cause  ""If we just look at the historical data, there is a scientific consensus that the global mean temperature has risen modestly during the twentieth century,"" said Myron Ebell, director of global warming and environmental policy at the Competitive Enterprise Institute. ""The impacts have been small and probably beneficial in aggregate. This historical data puts the onus of demonstration on those who think this gradual warming trend will accelerate and lead to dire consequences.""  The controlling driver of global temperature fluctuations, according to Dr. Benny Peiser of England's John Moore's University, is solar ray activity. ""Six eminent researchers from the Russian Academy of Science and the Israel Space Agency have just published a startling paper in one of the world's leading space science journals. The team of solar physicists claims to have come up with compelling evidence that changes in cosmic ray intensity and variations in solar activity have been driving much of the Earth's climate,"" Peiser was quoted as saying in the May 17 National Post.  Moreover, reports Peiser, Jan Veizer, one of Canada's top earth scientists, published a comprehensive review of recent findings and concluded, ""empirical observations on all time scales point to celestial phenomena as the principal driver of climate, with greenhouse gases acting only as potential amplifiers.""  Added Peiser, ""In fact, the explicit and implicit rejection of the 'consensus' is not restricted to individual scientists. It also includes distinguished scientific organizations such as the Russian Academy of Science and the U.S. Association of State Climatologists, both of which are highly skeptical of the whole idea.""  Heartland Institute - Article  And here's more:  Renowned Scientist Defects From Belief in Global Warming â Caps Year of Vindication for Skeptics  October 17, 2006  October 17, 2006  Washington DC - One of the most decorated French geophysicists has converted from a believer in manmade catastrophic global warming to a climate skeptic. This latest defector from the global warming camp caps a year in which numerous scientific studies have bolstered the claims of climate skeptics. Scientific studies that debunk the dire predictions of human-caused global warming have continued to accumulate and many believe the new science is shattering the media-promoted scientific âconsensusâ on climate alarmism.  Claude Allegre, a former government official and an active member of Franceâs Socialist Party, wrote an editorial on September 21, 2006 in the French newspaper L'Express titled âThe Snows of Kilimanjaroâ (For English Translation, click here: U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works ) detailing his newfound skepticism about manmade global warming. See: http://www.lexpress.fr/idees/tribune...asp?ida=451670 Allegre wrote that the âcause of climate change remains unknownâ and pointed out that Kilimanjaro is not losing snow due to global warming, but to local land use and precipitation changes. Allegre also pointed out that studies show that Antarctic snowfall rate has been stable over the past 30 years and the continent is actually gaining ice.  âFollowing the month of August experienced by the northern half of France, the prophets of doom of global warming will have a lot on their plate in order to make our fellow countrymen swallow their certitudes,â Allegre wrote. He also accused proponents of manmade catastrophic global warming of being motivated by money, noting that âthe ecology of helpless protesting has become a very lucrative business for some people!â  Allegre, a member of both the French and U.S. Academy of Sciences, had previously expressed concern about manmade global warming. ""By burning fossil fuels, man enhanced the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere which has raised the global mean temperature by half a degree in the last century,"" Allegre wrote 20 years ago. In addition, Allegre was one of 1500 scientists who signed a November 18, 1992 letter titled âWorld Scientists' Warning to Humanityâ in which the scientists warned that global warmingâs âpotential risks are very great.â See: Warning to Humanity  Allegre has authored more than 100 scientific articles, written 11 books and received numerous scientific awards including the Goldschmidt Medal from the Geochemical Society of the United States.  Allegre's conversion to a climate skeptic comes at a time when global warming alarmists have insisted that there is a âconsensusâ about manmade global warming. Proponents of global warming have ratcheted up the level of rhetoric on climate skeptics recently. An environmental magazine in September called for Nuremberg-style trials for global warming skeptics and CBS News â60 Minutesâ correspondent Scott Pelley compared skeptics to âHolocaust deniers.â See: U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works & Scott Pelley And Catherine Herrick On Global Warming Coverage - Public Eye In addition, former Vice President Al Gore has repeatedly referred to skeptics as ""global warming deniers.""  This increase in rhetorical flourish comes at a time when new climate science research continues to unravel the global warming alarmistsâ computer model predictions of future climatic doom and vindicate skeptics.  60 Scientists Debunk Global Warming Fears  Earlier this year, a group of prominent scientists came forward to question the so-called âconsensusâ that the Earth faces a âclimate emergency.â On April 6, 2006, 60 scientists wrote a letter to the Canadian Prime Minister asserting that the science is deteriorating from underneath global warming alarmists.  âObservational evidence does not support today's computer climate models, so there is little reason to trust model predictions of the futureâ¦Significant [scientific] advances have been made since the [Kyoto] protocol was created, many of which are taking us away from a concern about increasing greenhouse gases. If, back in the mid-1990s, we knew what we know today about climate, Kyoto would almost certainly not exist, because we would have concluded it was not necessary,â the 60 scientists wrote. See: Open Kyoto to debate  âIt was only 30 years ago that many of today's global-warming alarmists were telling us that the world was in the midst of a global-cooling catastrophe. But the science continued to evolve, and still does, even though so many choose to ignore it when it does not fit with predetermined political agendas,â the 60 scientists concluded.  .: U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works :: Press Room :.  So in conclusion, as the alleged science of evolution is based solely on pre-determined assumptions, so is the myth of Global Warming."

Merchant ships can't afford a 24/7 navy escort anymore than the average citizen can afford to hire body guards 24/7.  There's no legitimate reason why merchant ships should be unarmed and unable to address dangers that deliberately come after them.

I cannot hope to summarize what this is all about, please refer to:  Philosophical Critiques: The Human Person - 3   One could also consider the social development of an infant, inasmuch as humans are, in most cases, very social animals.  According to primatologist Sarah Blaffer Hrdy, the human species is specifically developed to be part of a social system and a newborn infant comes ready made to push all the buttons of the system:

fact_2207	fact	Yes, really.  Lungs from swim bladders? Takes millions upon millions of years? What's so crazy about that?  Again, minor changes over sufficient time add up to what?  What makes you think that lots of little changes can't do the job (apart from incredulity, that is)?  Where is the barrier to stop minor changes adding up to big changes?  Where did you get the idea that a dog evolved to a human? It's exactly that kind of comment that makes people with a smattering of scientific education say 'go read a book on biology before you say that dogs evolved into humans'.  Humans did not evolve from dogs and ToE has never suggested that this is so. It's that kind of comment that makes me wonder how much you know about biology. My nephew knows that humans evolved from human like ancestors; not dogs and he's only 11, for Christ sake!
fact_1068	fact	I'm not even going to comment on the '6000 years old' statement.  As to predicting the orbits of planets, it's simple. Due to the laws of gravity, planets go in regular circular or elliptical paths. By observing a planet for a period of time and making measurements, you can find out mathematically how that planet moves, how long it takes to complete one orbit, where that orbit lies, how fast it moves e.t.c.
fact_381	fact	"The laws of physics are short, descriptive statements that describe the operation of certain natural phenomena that always seem to occur in the same way. Many times the ""laws of physics"" have been amended by further information, causing the law to be restated.  Actually, I think he meant the way that we have observed the universe and all of nature to operate."
fact_395	fact	"Well, there's a little more to it since the courts ruled that abortions have to be carried out in the first trimester when the fetus is much less developed than one that could survive outside the womb (or ""room"" if you prefer)."
fact_2213	fact	Really? I wasn't aware that the definition had changed. I do know that a definition was formulated as part of the modern synthesis back in the 1930s and 40s. That is the definition I learned some decades ago, it is the one I have always used, and it is the one that I still find in modern biology texts. It is also the one that all biologists that I know use, and of course the meaning definition of what evolutionary biologists mean when they talk about evolution should be determined by evolutionary biologists themselves. It seems kind of an empty exercise to invent a definition that isn't what evolutionary biologists mean and then argue against it in an effort to disprove evolution.  Let me put it this way, do you think that it would be acceptable in a discussion of Christianity if I were allowed to invent my own definition of what a Christian means when he talks about salvation?  So please, please tell us about some of these changing defintions. Like I said, I've been using the same one for over 40 years and wasn't aware that it had changed.
fact_1295	fact	"It's bad enough that you claim to oppose evolution when you don't even know what it is, but to correct someone on logic and get it backwards is really silly. If you limit your claims of creation to the simple assertion, ""God did it!"" without any specifics as to how, then you have answered no questions and explained nothing. Such empty assertions cannot be proven wrong. Such an assertion says nothing about the methods used by God, and that is what scientists study. There are lots of scientists, evolutionary biologists among them, who believe in a Creator God.  Science is not a matter of proving something right. Scientific theories are explanations of the processes and mechanisms that account for the facts that have been observed. In science, the facts are the observations. The process of science is a process of testing those theories, again and again. The body of scientific knowledge is composed of tested theories that have NOT been shown to be wrong. The more a theory has been tested, the more secure it is, even to the point that it is no longer doubted by those who are informed about the topic. How many physicists do you think there are that doubt the the earth orbits the sun? Is that a fact? How many nuclear physicists doubt the existence of atoms or electrons?  Why is it that all creationists seem to be so ignorant of science that they think a theory is some sort of wild guess and that if they are ""proven"" they will grow up to be facts? Did it ever occur to any of you that you should actually learn about the topic before you try to instruct others? One thing that is always true of science is that it is predictive - and ""God did it"" offers no predictions.  However, if you wish to assert that ancient mythology is a historical record of the events, you have made assertions that can be checked. For example, if you assert that the creation took place about 6 to 10 thousand years ago, then we can predict that nothing in the entire universe can be older than that. But clearly there are. And we have observed events that happened longer ago than that. For example, SN 1987 A was a supernova that was observed in 1987 within 3 hours of the first light reaching earth. It's distance from earth has been measured by more than one method. It is 170,000 light years away. In other words, SN 1987 A exploded 170,000 years ago. A creationist's answer is to claim that his god created the light already on its way to earth, complete with the history of an explosion that never happened. Ultimately, creationism falls back on an untestable miracle for which there is no evidence.  So if you want to believe in miracles and mythology, great! But if you wish to argue science, then shouldn't you at least learn what it is? If you claim that a theory is wrong shouldn't you at least know what that theory is?  By the way, I am getting the definition of evolution from memory. I have been using it for many years. It was first stated some 70 or 80 years ago. Anyone who has taken a course in evolutionary biology heard a similar definition the first day of class. Any text on evolutionary biology or that has a chapter on evolution will have a similar definition. It is common knowledge - and that's why I ask, if you don't know what evolution is, how do you know that you are opposed to it?"
fact_1281	fact	"What in the name of heaven is ""passive particulate selection"" is that found in quantitative genetics in some obscure corner - I challenge you to produce a reference to the term in the open literature. And Mendel's theory was itself (if anything is) particulate in nature and it was NOT derived from Darwin at all. It preceded Darwin and later of course DID serve as a plug in addition to supplant Darwins own inadequate theory of inheritance. And of course Mendel is long ago supplanted by much more detailed and modern genetic knowledge.  As to ""dynamic sytemic adaptation"" I also suggest you need to document where that term originates from other than yourself. Just what does that mean which is NOT covered by the vary-select-inherit process? Please tell us oh mighty lagomorph how antibiotic resistance arises by ""dynamic systemic adaptation"" instead of plain old VSI processes and how you distinguish the two.  [QUOTEHave to go now.[/QUOTE]  Good because my tolerance for people who pontificate in pseudoscientific terms while pretending to themselves that they know what they are talking about is wearing very very thin."
fact_168	fact	"I believe it to be the case that marriage existed prior to any legal recognition of the relationship. If this is true, it seems reasonable to conclude that the state, for whatever reasons, wanted to encourage that particular relationship. Now, if it did so in order to foster an atmosphere where family life can best be nurtured and brought to maturity, that's well and good. But I still disagree with your conclusion that ""there's nothing about building a life together that requires the participants to be of differing genders."" As a general proposition, I agree with this. Two individuals can certainly build a life together without any encouragement from the state. However, in a strict legal sense, there certainly are requirements one must fulfill in order to receive the benefits the state wishes to confer. In other words, legislatures have determined not only that they want to foster and encourage an atmosphere conducive for family life, they have determined that the best way to accomplish this is by encouraging the relationship to be between two individuals of the opposite sex.  Now, I will probably say this more than once so that I ensure it has been taken into account: my primary purpose in starting this thread (and my other posts) is not WHETHER the definition of marriage should be changed, but if it is to be changed, WHO should change it."

fact_632	fact	So stop relying on press reports. The original paper is at    sciencemag.org/cgi/reprint/317/5835/214.pdf (add the standard prefixes)
fact_154	fact	Actually energy can be caused by matter. Newton's Theory of Gravitation shows that gravity is an effect of the presence of mass. The presence of a second mass within the gravitation field of the first mass gives the matter gravitational potential energy, which, without an opposite force to balance it, is converted into kinetic energy.
fact_1256	fact	"My bet is I know more about it than you do. I am aware of the ""big picture"" because I know that evolutionary biology doesn't apply the the origin of the universe. Please explain how the origin of the universe applies to genetic information. Why does a change in a population of organisms require an increase in information?"
fact_2039	fact	"You just provided good evidence that schools use an atheist presupposition - that atheism is entrenched in public schools. Who proclaims that man and chimps sharing a common ancestor is an established scientific theory? A theory is defined as a well tested explanation that unifies a broad range of observation. A theory has accepted principles. I know of no religion other than atheism - certainly not the Judeo Christian religion - that believe a creator made the common ancestor that man and chimps share. Since far more than half of US residents believe basically the creation account in Genesis, then there's not enough unification or acceptance of that ""theory"". That theory has a presupposition of abiogenesis, or a very similar non scientific basis.   Another proof of the atheist entrenchment in public schools would be the organized efforts (largely of the teaching establishment) to keep ID out."
fact_1530	fact	"Note that at the very beginning it said ""allegations"", as in alleged. Alleged isn't the same thing as hard and provable evidence. So this is nothing more than supposition, theory, hearsay, musings, etc.      Come back when you've got some hard evidence!"
fact_801	fact	Yes, but how do you legally get it into international waters? Once there, where do you go? There aren't too many ports where ordinance is allowed. Since I am a law abiding citizen, where, other than international waters, may I legally have a gun?
fact_1524	fact	"so do you think the Soviets, er -- silly me -- I mean Darwinists, will put 2 + 2 together and proclaim to the world that since one's environment (diet, environmental toxins, etc) can cause disease that one could eliminate/control this disease by eliminating the environmental source that's causing it?   I think this would explain why cancer is getting to be so wide-spread in society and why younger and younger people are developing it. The cause of disease has nothing to do with the genes themselves...as Dr. Bruce Lipton says, ""It's the environment, stupid."" Of course if this little secret got out (that people could cure themselves by changing their internal and/or external environments) then Big medicine, including millions and millions of people would be without a paycheck. We can't have that. The sad thing though, as your article indicates, is disease doesn't just end with the person who has it...diseases often get carried forward into future generations, making children (and their children) more vulnerable."
fact_815	fact	"I'll ask the question that needs to be asked.  If France qualifies as a ""developed nation"" as we've been lead to believe, why did the homeowner have to resort to getting close enough that he could strangle the burglar?  Surely if you're a developed nation, you're not going to force your own people to put themselves in harms way while they're in the process of saving themselves, right?"
fact_1242	fact	Evolutionists do not likely believe we started with nothing nor with two elements nor do they believe that combining elements with time created physical laws or anything else metioned. The author here either does not believe this and is intentionally misrepresenting his opponents, or he is grossly misinformed about evolution, or both.
fact_183	fact	Nobody's armed in England, but the criminals still go armed. What's your excuse for that?

fact_2011	fact	There is a pretty huge difference.  Civil unions aren't nationally recognized, for one thing, since not every state has them. If you travel to a state that does not offer civil unions, then your union is not valid there.  I think there's a problem with dissolving those unions as well.  The big difference, though, are the rights that these unions provide. There are over 1,000 legal protections and rights that marriage provides that civil unions don't. I'll try and find a list of differences.

fact_197	fact	Ah, IIDB stands for Internet Infidels Discussion Board. It's a board similar to this one, only a large portion of the posters there are actual professionals in fields like evolutionary biology, etc (I beleive we have a few scientists and teachers here - I'm a Geological Engineer myself, but not even close to the large amount of experts there). It's really a good place to educate yourself in evolution and various other fields (I know I've learned a lot there). There are also plenty of other subjects (similar to the Religion and other sections on here). If you want to check it out, it's at http://http://iidb.org/vbb/index.php
fact_2007	fact	Oh, I don't know... he could be on to something. Of course, applying his and Kurtz's logic to other situations could explain some other modern day mysteries. For example:  From Colson's article:  For thirty years I have been going into prisons across America. It has been a wonderful opportunity to share Christ, but it has also been depressing to watch the prison population explode at the same time: When I left prison thirty years ago, there were 239,000 inmatesânow there are 2.3 million in America.  Clearly, his 30 years of visiting prisons has caused the explosion in the prison population. Maybe is was all the Bible thumping...  Ahem.

Liberty encompases all people in all passions even if we disprove of thier PERSONAL behavior.
fact_181	fact	Mandatory storage laws are in violation of the Second Amendment because they interfere with personal defense, by making your defensive weapon inaccessible when you need it. I don't care if you use the justification of it only applying when you're not at home, that's not good enough; trouble can follow you home and attack before you can unpack your weapon now that you're there.  Then there's the fact that mandatory storage laws serve no crime fighting purpose. Responsible people already lock up their guns, they keep them out of the hands of children and strangers, they don't need a law to tell them to do what they're already doing. Such a proposal takes away responsibility, it suggests that nobody is capable of being trusted unless everything is spelled out by federal law and carries strict penalties with it.  There's also the fact that the police have better things to do than penalize people for something that isn't a crime or a threat to anyone's safety. Who should law enforcement be targeting more, a dangerous gang with ties to the mexican mafia, or a single mom who forgot about putting her pistol in the safe before going to the grocery store?  Police resources are limited as is. I don't see why we should be squandering what resources we have, going after people for technical violations rather than true crimes that victimize anyone and everyone.
fact_195	fact	No, the origin of the universe has nothing to do with the theory of evolution. The origin of life has nothing to do with the theory of evolution. Scientific disciplines have bounds. Biologists don't have to account for cosmology because it has nothing to do with the evolution of life on earth. However the universe came into being doesn't affect the theory of evolution. However life first arose has no bearing on the theory of evolution. The ultimate origin has nothing to do with the theory of evoution. I don't see where the definition you quoted does anything to make this point.......
fact_2013	fact	But my relationship is between a man and woman. You would be asking marriage to be redefined to do that. Remember, part of what defines marriage is that it is between a man and woman.
fact_803	fact	The difference, Eddie is simply this. If the Constitution needs to be changed, the founders instigated a means to do so. Said means is doubly hard as to make sure what is done, has been given much thought and study. The plan afoot today by the Gun Grabbers is to incrementally usurp the rights of free men, until, the fait accompli has been established. If the Right to Keep and Bear Arms, or any of the other rights guaranteed by the Constitution are to be abridged, they must ne done so by legal means, i.e. constitutional amendment.
fact_1532	fact	But you are. You can't just claim someone is not a person and therefore say you are not imposing beliefs on them. If this were the case then I'd just say you aren't a person and therefore when I hurt you it wouldn't be wrong.

fact_1240	fact	Nope, it just shows people are getting sick of having the anti-abortion movement invading their public life.

fact_817	fact	"That's questionable. In Casey, Scalia pointed out,  ""But if in reality our process of constitutional adjudication consists primarily of making value judgments; if we can ignore a long and clear tradition clarifying an ambiguous text, as we did, for example, five days ago in declaring unconstitutional invocations and benedictions at public high school graduation ceremonies, Lee v. Weisman, 505 U.S. 577 (1992); if, as I say, our pronouncement of constitutional law rests primarily on value judgments, then a free and intelligent people's attitude towards us can be expected to be (ought to be) quite different. The people know that their value judgments are quite as good as those taught in any law school -- maybe better. If, indeed, the 'liberties' protected by the Constitution are, as the Court says, undefined and unbounded, then the people should demonstrate, to protest that we do not implement their values instead of ours.""  Arguably, the language of the Second Amendment is ambiguous. Thus decades of controversy about its true meaning. But in Heller, Scalia decides that the court, not the people, should clarify such text."

fact_1297	fact	End the guessing right now. Don't guess. The meaning of the 2nd Amendment is explained in two documents: 1) The Militia Act of 1792 and 2) Federalist Papers #29. Both of which was written by the same Congress and same men who wrote the 2nd Amendment, the Constitution, and established the political philosophy of our country.  First the Militia Act states WE AREA ALL IN THE MILITIA and that all citizens bring thier own weapons. - http://www.constitution.org/mil/mil_act_1792.htm  The more broader philosophy and intent of the 2nd Amendment and the Militia Act is further explained in the Federalist #29. - http://federalistpapers.com/federalist29.html  These documents are the thoughts and intent of the men who wrote the 2nd Amendment. So gun control slime are guessing or trying to reinvent history when they think gun ownership is collective. None of these documents anywhere support the collective idea.

The volunteer parents work in plain clothes, armed with concealed semi-automatic pistols, and are trained by Israelâs home guard. It is significant that in the more than a quarter century between Maalot and the incident mentioned above when the citizen guards shot down the terrorist in the school in 2002, not a single child was murdered in an Israeli school!"""
fact_383	fact	"#1 - Evolution continues today. Some organisms evolve relatively quickly. It has and is being observed. Do some research.  #2 - Science uses hypothesis to explain observed phenomena.

When the isthmus of Panama was formed it disrupted ocean currents causing a drying of the region in Africa where we are thought to originate.

fact_1724	fact	Evolution wasn't introduced until 1859. When did abortion become popular?  The industrial revolution occurred in the 1800s. Maybe that was the cause of abortion's alleged popularity.  Grover Cleveland was elected in the 1800s. Clearly he had something to do with the alleged increase in abortion's popularity.  The American Civil War occurred in the 1800s. It must have been the impetus for the rise in popularity of abortion.  A human embryo does have features that look like gill slits. They are not gills but pharyngeal clefts. No modern book presents any information that human embryros have gill slits as if it is fact.

fact_340	fact	I have posted responses to Demon38âs earlier post. I have offered DNA findings as evidence to begin with. It is not my evidence, but scientific evidence. That is the only evidence that I will provide in this discussion. I think there is ample evidence to cause scientists to rethink their theories, evidence that they do not want to accept because it puts certain hypothesis they have advanced in a poor light.

fact_60	fact	"You're off on the wrong argument, clearly stated above is the issue of an indivudal pharmacists refusing service, a service that the pharmacy offers. If the employee picks and chooses who to service, based on religious reasons, it looks in black and white to violate the law, state and federal:  The Federal Civil Rights Act guarantees all people the right to ""full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, and accommodations of any place of public accommodation, without discrimination or segregation on the ground of race, color, religion, or national origin.""    Are you suggesting that's not how the law reads? Or are you still attacking the straw man you set up i.e. forcing a pharmacy to stock specific goods....which is indeed ridiculous, both to bring up and to defend, neither of which I'm doing.  The law will of course be interpereted, as will the actions of indivudals, but it's clear that if discrimination is involved on the basis of religion, it is a legal issue.  -Mach"
fact_2365	fact	The value of logical reasoning is dependent upon your axioms. Highly religious people are no less capable of reasoning logically than anyone else - but the unshakeable axiom that their personal version of god really exists enters into every equation. For you, one axiom is the existence of Vitality; volition made quantifiable, and the other is that darwinian evolution must be wrong and worthless in every respect.  There is no logical reason for you to deride NS the way you do; it's an integral part of any evolutionary theory that seeks to explain the big picture of how the organisms we see around us came to be; the occurrence of mutations, volitional or otherwise is not enough on its own. But your axioms prevent you from incorporating it into EAM and getting on with your life.

fact_1888	fact	I've examined Hall's papers and they make interesting reading. However, further research, including some undertaken by Hall himself, has informed the debate greatly.  For one thing, many of the experimental results to which Hall originally proposed sub-population hypermutation (your 'hypermutation as a eusocial response') as an explanation have proved inconsistent with that hypothesis. The Amplification Mutation model described above is a much better fit, correctly predicting such details as clonally-related bacteria possessing redundant lac- copies in addition to the lac+ revertant. The articles I've already cited, though they focus on the Cairns system's experimental vulnerabilities as the origin of the recent directed/adaptive mutagenesis misperception, also include Hall's work in their assessment.  Hall himself performed a followup experiment to his work on anomalous rates of trpAB+ dual revertants, acknowledging that a colleague's suggestion, that stochastically-occurring trpA+trpB revertants were growing on waste byproducts secreted by non-growing trpAtrpB+ revertants was probably correct.   In short, though hypermutation of a sub-population does occur sometimes, it is not always an organismic response (eg mutation promoters coincidentally amplified along with useful genes), and the 'successful' mutants do not always, or even mostly, arise from within that subpopulation.   Also, you still seem reluctant to acknowledge the implications of the existence of a physical mechanism for hypermutation under stress. It must itself have evolved somehow - which makes it logically (as well as empirically, as evidenced by my original post in which 4/5ths of the adaptive bacteria exhibited no increased mutation rate) not a prerequisite for evolution. It's just one more adaptation to the environment - in this case, the environment's potential for inducing - though carcinogens or simple uncertainty at the molecular level - genetic change.
fact_1650	fact	He has a bit more basic information about R.A.T.E. on his webpage.  TO also has a page critiquing R.A.T.E. methodology.  Sorry, I know you're looking for more substantial personal feedback, but this is some good basic information that doesn't rely upon a billion links.  You also might consider asking this question on iidb.org, and maybe Dr. Meert will respond to you personally.  More importantly, let us not get hung up on analyzing the raw empirical data only. For example, if I use a stopwatch to time how long it takes for light to flood the room after I turn on the switch, and I come up with 0.06s, you can't argue with my empirical data: I timed it at 0.06s. The fact that human response time is comparatively lousy and that a stopwatch is awful for extremely short time intervals is more significant that the stopwatch reading itself. This is the primary error that R.A.T.E. makes.

Let me give you the cliff notes version- the purpose of the Spanish Inquisition was to find anyone who didn't believe exactly what the Church told them to and if they were found to be ""heretics,"" they were gruesomely tortured until they said they believed, or if they didn't they were killed.  Now I hope you can see why saying the Spanish Inquisition was ""at times very strict"" is a GIGANTIC understatement."

fact_546	fact	Well, I incorrectly assumed that anyone attempting to enter the discussion would at least have a grasp of the most fundamental principles. It is quite strange to encounter someone in this day and age who lacks any knowledge whatsoever of the mechanism of adaptation since it was explained 150 years ago. It is one of Darwin's original hypotheses, independently arrived at by Alfred Russel Wallace. Darwin called this mechanism of adaptive change natural selection. It is based on a few simple observations and inferences. Here is how Ernst Mayr, formulator of the biological species concept and one of the evolutionary biologists responsible for the modern synthesis, put it:
fact_1877	fact	That's an interesting subject, I had not heard of that b4. Did our bodies once produce Vitamin C?.
fact_220	fact	You mean, intelligent design, which has been proven in court to be not science, and to be a front for certain religious agenda's, and straight forward arguments based on ignorance of the evidence and logical fallacies.  If you look at the organizations that push I.D. , you will see they have a religious agenda . The discovery institute is funded by religious organizations, and every one of the board will admit they thing the 'intelligent designer' is the Christian god. Read the 'wedge strategy' from them.
fact_208	fact	"First of all why would you want to know if I have an alternative theory to one that is known to be false ? Are you found of false theories?  A true theory would be a replacement not an alternative.  The Wrong Answer Will Always Be The Wrong Answer!   If evolution was true there would be overwhelming , uncontestable evidence, there is no uncontestable evidence. Little that is any more than pure imagination.  Theories start out as hypothesis and are then subject to experimentation and observation. When they fail they are discarded. For instance spontaneous generation was disproved by Pasteur and discarded as a theory.  Evolution which is not a theory ,although it is called one ,has been falsified nine ways to Sunday. Two of Darwin's own falsifications have come to pass and ignored. The Galopagos Finches have proven to interbreed which destoys a great deal of the so called basis of his theory. ""Extinct"" animals and plants are found alive and ignored as evidence against evolution. Theories are made to be challenged but evidence against evolution is suppressed.  Evolutionist had to revive spontaneous generation although it is scientifically impossible because without it atheism is impossible. The atheist must have a story no matter how bizzare to justify his faith . Science suffers because of this.  My theory is that this planet is exactly what Einstein said it was , a place designed by a Supreme Being to be inhabited by people.  The evidence is creation itself. If there is a creation there must be a Creator.   Nothing has ever been observed to self assemble and there is no known process that could accomplish that.  Animals and plants just like the ones alive today have always existed. Many have gone extinct but death is not evidence of evolution.  Human beings are incapable of creating a grain of sand from nothing.  There are grains of sand so there is an intelligence greator than ours that did.  The perfect balance seen in the anthropic principle tells of a Creator.  The unbelievable complexity of the human body makes evolution impossible.  DNA can not exist without proteins. Proteins are coded by the information in the DNA molecule. They had to come into being simultaneously.  Pre-biotic natural selection is impossible , there is no process to affect the evolution of DNA outside of a living organism.  To look at a building is to have absolute empirical proof there was a builder.  To look at creation and say there was no Creator is to enter an intellectually free zone."
fact_1687	fact	"Actually the Apocrypha is made up of pre-Christian texts, and late 4th century is a bit of a stretch for the new testament, certainly all its component texts were widely accepted by the 2nd century. I don't whether it is ""generally accepted"" that the text was altered, it seems to me that you are projecting your own views based on the hypotheses of some scholars on to Biblical scholarship in general."
fact_1693	fact	Well either the Pottenger cat/pig/mouse thing is either the truth or they made the whole thing up. I think we are seeing a mirror of this experiment in society today...please notice how diseases are striking people at younger and younger ages....it's not going to get any better, either because people are not taught the reality about nutrition -- and that what they eat not only effects them, but their offspring as well.
fact_2173	fact	Not really. Even Darwin recognized that it is populations that evolve, not individuals. Natural selection is differential reproductive success. I suspect that you aren't able to understand anything that Dawkins has said.
fact_793	fact	Do some research. People collect functional tanks and aircraft. Did you ever hear of the Confederate Air Force? They restore and fly military aircraft. As for tanks, there are many web sites that promote collecting tanks and other military vehicles. And people shoot laws rockets. They just do not shoot live HE rounds. It is a little expensive.

And that fact makes the old creationist plum about how evolutionary theory is dogmatic or that evolutionary biologists aren't allowed to disagree with ""standard"" theory a laugh. Clearly, evolutionary biologists disagree and those disagreements are published openly. Science makes progress by questioning and disagreement."
fact_7	fact	The big bang theory actually describes the universe very well and is the best working model we have. No one has developed a complete model of the universe that can describe all observations. That doesn't make the model completely false, it just makes it incomplete.  Back in the day, Newtonian physics was dominant. Then came Einstein's Theory of General Relativity (which is fascinating in discovering that space and time are one thing), and the Big Bang Theory which developed on top of that. There are problems with General Relativity, which breaks down the closer the model gets to the actual moments of the beginning of the universe.  I'm going to say it again: the model isn't wrong, its incomplete. Models get replaced by better models that better fit our observations.  Big Bang merely describes the way the universe works, it doesn't make any predictions as to what was responsible for setting these events in motion.

fact_778	fact	Well, an abortion can't technically be called 'fetal homicide' because it isn't illegal... homicide is. If a woman kills her toddler, that is homicide, and it isn't legal, and I don't see how it ever could/would be... all murder is illegal, but to call an abortion murder is really only your personal opinion on the issue, because as of now it is a legal procedure. Some people consider it to be murder, and some don't.. it isn't an open and shut thing either way; if it were, there wouldn't be so much debate over it, and if it were considered to be murder all around, no questions, then it would not be legal. Maybe the laws will change someday, who knows.. but right now it's not illegal for a woman to have an abortion. You can call it a double standard, but again that is mainly just opinion.  But I also have had friends who have had abortions because they didn't want to 'get fat'.. I know of one girl who had 7 by the time she was 22... that is pretty disturbing, and I don't think that it's really right to do it for reasons like that... like I said to her, if she were so afraid of getting pregnant, or getting 'fat', she should have either not had sex or she should have used protection... there are ways to prevent pregnancy, and birth control costs a hell of a lot less than an abortion (especially 7 times).. but at the same time I also had a friend who got pregnant, and got scared, and made an appointment to a clinic, and once she got there she didn't think she could go through with it, and now she has a healthy, adorable 5 year old and she is very thankful that she didn't have the abortion after all... but in the cases of my friends, all I could do was offer an opinion if they asked, but I didn't feel I had the right to tell them what to do either way. You really can't know what is going on in a woman's mind when she is considering an abortion, or after she has had one done.
fact_1491	fact	"I know..... I've wondered from time to time exactly what this improbability is. I mean most of us would find the probabilities of dealing a given sequence from a deck of 52 card pretty ""improbable"". I guess its best to avoid those tricky fact things and stick to words only."

fact_1490	fact	"I believe Jesus actually can be both. Jesus called himself ""the son of man"", and we all fall into that category. Jesus calmed his father was in heaven. Jesus asked his mother, ""Who is my brother or my sister?""   How can Jesus be the son of man and yet the son of God? What prayer did Jesus give when asked?  Jesus told those who asked for a prayer from him to pray; ""Our Father, who art in heaven."" Hold up- If we pray, ""our father"", then who are we?  We are the son of man. We are the son of God. Maybe getting to know yourself brings you closer to God than anyone else can. What does being born again mean? All things born have a mother and a father.   I believe love is logical. And Love is the simple key to understanding yourself and your neighbor. No other key will get you closer to self understanding. Now its logical to say a designer places a little of himself in everything he makes. If this is true then God is in us. Maybe love and a mirror is the best book you'll ever read on the subject of God."
fact_779	fact	Actually they are what make us animals. It's the DNA that determines that this particular animal will be a human.

The strawman you are attempting to construct is just that - a strawman.  As to ""the majority of Americans are against gay marriage"", who really gives a flying emoticonXCensored? The majority of Americans thought that slavery was acceptable, that blacks and whites shouldn't marry, that ""seperate-but-equal"" policies were acceptable (and equal), that women should not have equal rights as men, that discrimination on the basis of gender, race, etc. was acceptable, and on and on.

fact_6	fact	"First of all, why would you take humans out of consideration? Doesn't the verse I posted above show where in addition to God blessing Adam and Eve in marriage, it speaks of God giving humanity dominion over every creature on Earth which humanities personal history is evidence of actually happening?   So since we are made in Gods image:  Gen 1:26 Then God said, ""Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness; and let them rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky and over the cattle and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.""  And notice how here, as He decides to create us in His image, He repeats Himself by giving us the same authority over all living things as He did when He blessed Adam and Eve and commanded them to be fruitful and multiply 2 verses later at Genesis 1:28? So just because homosexuality is found in the animal kingdom, who also never sinned against God and fell from grace by the way, it's irrational to compare animals sexual habits to Mans as we are made in Gods image and live by different morals and values than animals do. And btw, welcome to the forum. emoticonXGood"
fact_1335	fact	Actually new organs are developed only by MODIFICATION of existing ones. But those modifications are due to chages in the existing physical and chemical structures. New chemical structures can however arise easily by mutation. For example mutation of a single base in chloroplast DNA results in effectively total resistance to the microbial peptide tentoxin. One can indeed turn it on and turn it off with a little genetic manipulation. In addition the specific mechanisms involved are well described in the literature.

fact_976	fact	"Such as what? It is not like putting two electrodes into the Earth and getting a measurement on some sort of gadget. The only way to measure how old something is, is by using a set of arbitrary assumptions. There are few things that you need to take into account, such as the rate of decay, and so on.  Creationists know that there is something seriously wrong with the radio-metric dating methods. Explain this then, carbon dating of wood under lava that was erupted from Rangitoto (an island volcano near Auckland, NZ) indicates that the erruption was around 200 years ago (the name is said to mean ""Red Sky"", suggesting that the Maoris, who have been their for 1000 years at the most, witnessed this event). Yet potassium-argon dating of the lava rock has given ages of up to half a million years old! Now this alone is a big flaw. Any person who uses their logic can tell that the result of the potassium-argon is way out, it should be less than 200 years. The radio-carbon date is only restricted to thousands of years, because even after several hundreds of thousands of years, there will be no more radio-carbon left.  The above came from Snelling, A., ""Dating Dilemma: Fossil wood in ""ancient"" sandstone"", Creation  21(3):39-41.  Creationists don't have (by their own admissions) all of the answers when it comes to radio-metric dating methods, but they can see enough that there is something seriously wrong with the underlying assumptions. Professor Richard Mauger says: ""In general, dates in the ""correct ball park"" are assumed to be correct and are published, but those in disagreement with other data are seldom published nor are discrepencies fuly explained."""
fact_1447	fact	Right. That is the white morph in winter fur. Here it is in summer fur. And here is the blue morph in summer fur and winter fur. The fact is that some arctic foxes never are pure white. And it doesn't take a matter of months for them to change from dark to light. I spent a year where I saw lots of these animals every day. Remind me to tell you about Archie, who lived under the C Battery mess hall.  But that's not really the point. Your clumsy bait and switch was beginning a discussion about evolution and then trying to represent the seasonal change in color of foxes as evolution. The ability of the foxes to change may be evolution but the fact that they do change every year and then back again isn't.

It has only been observed to change minor phenotypes (shell thickness, type of bee).

fact_1686	fact	Yes, the mythology has been around for a long time. Most cultures had their own. You have adopted the mythology of ancient Hebrews. You probably even somehow reconcile both stories of creation in your mind. But the technology and the techniques to use that technology didn't develop until about 400 years ago. Every since then we have used the idea that we can learn about our world by careful observation and experimentation. About 150 years ago, Darwin and Wallace recognized a mechanism for why living things change. About the same time, Mendel recognized how those changes were passed on to off spring. That the Biblical mythology of creation was false was actually demonstrated by men who believed in creation. They tried to reconcile their Bible with what was obviously true from the observations they made. But creationism has only been around since the early 20th century. It grew out of the anti-science movement of fundamentalism. It actually became popular in the 1960's.
fact_1876	fact	Because the common defintions of God include such characteristics as sentience, omnipotence, omniscience, etc, none of which would apply to a multiverse. All you're trying to do here is say that God exists by changing the defintion of God. That's cheating.

But there are some relevant verses that speak to the rightness or wrongness of marriage in different situations; most of which refer to moral issues which is something people in this generation don't want to consider at all. For example, here the bible speaks about keeping the marriage BED pure and undefiled.   Hbr 13:4 Marriage {is to be held} in honor among all, and the {marriage} bed {is to be} undefiled; for fornicators and adulterers God will judge.  And here is where God consecrated the relationship (Marriage) between Man and Woman through Adam and Eve. He also gave Man dominion over all the animals of the World at this time.   No where does the bible refer to gay marriage anywhere in the positive sense as the concept was never raised or dreamt of by anyone in the ancient world, homosexuals included. Only in this generation have the morals and values of society become so reprobate that these various unnatural forms of sexual perversions are seen as right and normal.  Gen 1:28 Then God blessed them(Adam and Eve), and God said to them, ""Be fruitful and multiply; fill the earth and subdue it; have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the air, and over every living thing that moves on the earth.""  Exd 22:19 ""Whoever has sex with an animal shall surely be put to death.  Sex with animals was once a death penalty offense. Today, we have web sites promoting it.  Lev. 20:13 ""'If a man lies with a man as one lies with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable. They must be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads.  ROM 1:26 Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their   women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones.  27 In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion.  32 Although they know God's righteous decree that those who do such things   deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things but also   approve of those who practice them.  Now all one must do to rationally determine that God, through His word condemns the concept of homosexual marriage is to look at his attitude on homosexuality. If God considers homosexuality so unnatural an act and a death penalty offense under the OT Law, do you really believe that He thinks gay marriage is right, acceptable or normal?"
fact_235	fact	Well, in the case above, it was step-by-step. First, an existing enzyme was modified to a new use, and over time, became refined to work better and better. This is the way evolution works. Nothing is de novo; it's always a modfication of something else. Second, a mutation produced a regulator that only allowed the enzyme to be produced if the substrate was available. Again, this was refined by natural selection over time. In the end, the newly-evolved system was irreducibly complex, because all three parts have to be present for the system to work.   And do show us your numbers proving that such processes can't produce new information. If you don't know how, I'd be pleased to show you how a mutation changes the information in a population.
fact_1862	fact	Bingo. Relationships between appendices of closely related species still suggest that the appendix used to have a different function, namely digestion of roughage. Linky. (Plus what Otto said, again.)
fact_553	fact	  Really Brady. It is widely recognized that Mr. Heston gave away a very promising film career in order to take such an unpopular stand at that time. In fact he worked very little in films after that. I think the above statement was a political one, an anti-gun one, without much fact to back it up.  I don't think a man of such principle changes his mind when all he actually work to accomplish comes to pass.   But you can push your poison just as far as you want to. You have a first Amendment right to do so. Mr. Heston would have wanted it that way!
fact_49	fact	A belief in Adam and Eve is a fundamental necessity to being a Christian at all. Jesus Christ believed in Adam and Eve, after all He created them.  Gen 5:2 Male and female created he them; and blessed them, and called their name Adam, in the day when they were created.   [Adam means man]  These arevthe words of Jesus Christ. You will notice He refers to the Old Testement as History.  Mat 19:4  And he answered and said unto them, Have ye not read, that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female,   Mat 19:5 And said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh?   Mat 19:6 Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.   Mat 19:7 They say unto him, Why did Moses then command to give a writing of divorcement, and to put her away?   Mat 19:8 He saith unto them, Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives: but from the beginning it was not so.  Joh 1:1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.   Joh 1:2 The same was in the beginning with God.   Joh 1:3  All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.   Joh 1:4 In him was life; and the life was the light of men.   Joh 1:5 And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.   Joh 1:6 There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.   Joh 1:7 The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all men through him might believe.   Joh 1:8 He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light.   Joh 1:9 That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.   Joh 1:10 He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.   Hitler said it was necessary to attack America because the best aryan stock had already moved here and would evolve into the master race.

fact_1889	fact	NOt true,  California's ammendments are not doing as well as other states did. You are talking about a very liberal state. If it is decided that marriage is allowed by the courts, then you are talking about taking away rights people have been granted by the courts. I just don't think that will happen in Calf. much too liberal.

fact_2364	fact	Yes and no. Metaphorical creationism can't be disproved period as there are no hard facts to disprove. Literal creationism can be disproven on a number of factors, from the timeline, to events such as the flood.
fact_2402	fact	So you're saying that the ones who're eligible to carry a gun, those who're 21 or older, never been convicted of a crime, undergo fingerprinting, pay hundreds of dollars, attend an eight hour course held by the police, pass a firearms safety class, and weight three months to finally get their permit, would intentionally use it as an excuse to murder a teacher over a trivial matter like an unfavorable grade?  Wouldn't it just be easier, as well as more likely, for an emotionally disturbed student to just illegally bring a gun to school and kill their teacher, rather than waiting for a legal alternative to commit murder and go to prison anyway?
fact_2416	fact	And what is the full quote? Was it talking about, lets say for example, tutles, where over 90 percent of them die before reaching adulthood?  In many species, that is true. The 'rule of thumb' is that the more individuals do not reach adulthood, the more offspring that species has.

fact_2370	fact	"Really? Let's go to the OP. You said ""What this post explains is that Occamâs razor denies the accuracy of the bible because it makes too many assumptions to be more likely than the scientific explanation. Therefore, it is poor logic to accept the bible without further evidence.""  Now, if we are not ""to accept the bible"", what are we supposed to do?   ""See my first example for a reason that we should keep our beliefs uncomplicated whenever possible. If we didnât, we would be swamped with thousands of explanations for very simple events, and most of the explanations would be illogical.""  What do you mean by ""illogical"". In context it seems that you are saying ""wrong"". Are you? If not, specify in detail how do you think an ""illogical"" belief would be correct?  ""Except that Occam's razor is used for comparing hypotheses. ""  Back to a scientific use of parsimony. What are we comparing them for? ""Most likely"" or for which hypothesis is true and which is false? I submit that you are being disingenuous. You actually mean that you can use parsimony to decide which hypothesis is true, but, when pressed that this doesn't work, fall back to ""most likely"".  So let me ask, how ""most likely""? What are the odds? How do you compute them? Is ""most likely"" 51% ot 49% or 100% to 0% or somewhere in between? Or does it change for each situation? If ""most likely"" changes, then how do we know what you actually mean?"

fact_590	fact	Million year old moths didn't have the same capabilities as a present day moths. Million year old moths had capabilities that suited it to the million year old environment. Changes to moths have been subtle because it is a successful group of organisms, but changes do exist. Also, you keep harking on brains making creatures adaptive. An ant has a brain, yet an ant follows a very predictable program that can be quite easily simulated by computers. Of course there is always a randomizaion factor, but you mustn't confuse random action with adaptation.

The thing is though, if they were booting people for being biased against the movie, or because they would object to it's message, it stands to reason they wouldn't have let anyone in PZ Myer's party in as well. And do you seriously think that if Richard Dawkins' name was registered on the website they wouldn't have noticed that? I find that pretty hard to believe. It stands to reason there were other perhaps un-related reasons Myers was booted than his objections to the content of the movie. Furthermore, if the producer deliberately started a discussion, then it only further stands to reason he didn't mind opposing viewpoints toward the movie.

fact_1916	fact	"The source I cite is a Japanese Admiral who survived WW2, who took part in December 7. Those were his exact words, ""We were not fools to step in quicksand"". Meaning the officer was quite aware of civilian owned guns and yes they were afraid of grannies point shotguns out of kitchen windows. In China were there are no guns, the army was quite comfortable to rape and kill women and children at will.   Iraq is handing the 82nd Airborne thier hinnie as we speak. The militia is not going to stand head to head on a battlefield. That is the job of the standing army, not the militia. The civilians and irregulars in Iraq are doing EXACTLY what the militia will do in the USA agains a forgein invader. If you haven't noticed more solidered have been killed from the irregualrs than on the battlefield.   Sorry for the slow response I have been trying to prevent the homeless from freezing on the streets at night. I would not be going into the places where the homeless frequent at night if I did not have a gun. So there is one more reason why I carry a gun, to protect me while I save the homeless on the street."
fact_1725	fact	"I'm still having a hard time with this.   If nothing exists, no matter, then how can ""the number one"" exist? On what basis is it defined?   If there is only nothing, then you can't add to it, like I said 0+0=0.  I know this is getting slightly off topic and philosophical, but it would seem to me that ""concepts"", and I'm not sure exactly how that's being defined, must have a basis in reality, and therefore in matter."
fact_1043	fact	Again, your argument doesn't make good sense. First you say a fetus has no chance against someone who wants to kill it. I agree with this. Then you say a child has a chance against someone who wants to kill it...and you base this on the killer's changing his mind because the baby's crying. Where DID you go to school? Haven't you heard of the many shaken-baby-syndrome deaths that occurred because some idiotic person in custody of the child got fed up with the baby's crying? It just wouldn't stop crying, so they killed it.  Until a child gets old enough, smart enough and strong enough to outrun or hide from someone trying to kil them, they have no chance of survival. Your argument is all wet.  We are separated by reasoning and compassion from the other animals. Theirs is a life based on instinct and a few learned behaviors. For every example you can give me of animals protecting their own young, I can likely present an example where the males (sometimes the females) will kill the young of their species just to keep down the competition. A domestic bitch, when presented with a weakling in a litter of pups, will eat the weakling.
fact_1057	fact	Uh, it is, isn't it?
fact_1731	fact	Interesting, but it appears to ignore the fact that there is pre-existing variation (just look at the pictures). Emphasizing mutations is ok, but relying solely on them will probably skew results.

fact_1719	fact	"âWhen the pro-life movement began in the early 70's, being pro-life meant you were 100% opposed to any and all abortion. In the early 80's, that standard was watered down to include those who had rape, incest, and the life of the mother exceptions. Now in the 90's, things have declined so rapidly that someone who is only opposed to partial-birth abortions can sell themselves as pro-life.""- Pastor Matt Trewhella   How does that crow taste?"
fact_2210	fact	"Again Monty has shown that he doesn't bother to learn what he is talking about before he speaks. It is not true that science has ""found"" the mitochondrial Eve, nor is it true that it shows that one person can have all the DNA necessary for all the variation in human population. Both ideas are ridiculous in the extreme. The mitochondrial (note spelling monty) Eve is a mathematical concept. If the estimates of the mutation rate of mitochondrial DNA are correct, then she lived about 200,000 years ago or so.  And of course, the variation in human populations is carried by the nuclear DNA, not the mitochondria. High school biology students know this. And, of course, recent analysis has shown that every gene in the human genome has an average of 14 alleles. Since a single person can carry only two alleles of any gene, monty's assertion becomes pure nonsense.  Hank says:"
fact_396	fact	Well survival of the fittest was not Darwins term- although he may of used it it the later editions of the Origin. The phase was actually coined by Herbert Spencer in 1851.  Weiner could be forgiven for his statement- if he had read the first edition of the Origin (regarded as being the best version as it contains no responses to critiscsms that were levelled at the preceeding editions) he would not have come across it under Darwins name.  It is moot really, as natural selection is the term that is used in this context today.
fact_382	fact	Because you cannot reverse an incorrect United States Supreme Court decision with a ballot. Simple as that.  Additionally, prior to 1973, abortion was already settled democratically in most states.  And, regardless of whether 99.9% of the people in the US approve of the court's decision in Roe, that decision would still be judicial activism, and as such, would still merit reversal by the Supreme Court.

fact_157	fact	Hi NATO, I agree that irresponsible industrial pollution is damaging the environment and would never deny that at all. Acid Rain which is a side effect of air pollution has polluted more lakes, streams and rivers than direct dumping has and that is a direct result of heavy metals and other toxins being spewed into the atmosphere by industrial smoke stacks. So this reality goes without saying in my opinion.  But environmental pollution is very different than extending the claim to the next level of Global Warming which implies that the worlds atmosphere is now incapable of repairing itself. That is the crux of this argument and if the atmosphere were so polluted that the Earth was unable to repair itself, then the air quality here in NH would be as polluted as it is in China and Russia even though we have no industrial air polluters at all to speak of here. That would be solid evidence that the volume of pollutants in the atmosphere is overwhelming the Earths ability to repair itself. But our air quality is pristine in comparison to any and all third world countries who are the largest polluters due to their lack of having any industrial pollution safeguards in place.  So we must make the distinction between environmental pollution and air pollution clear because the Global Warming fraud is based specifically on the claim that air pollution is changing our weather and warming the planet, since all of the scientific evidence belies that claim.
fact_631	fact	I see. You are claiming that this is the case with every single beneficial mutation in every species through all time? If that is not what you are saying, then what is your point? Suppose what you say is true half the time. Then the gene gets passed on half the time. And what if the mutation occurs in the larger male?
fact_625	fact	What he was saying is that he needed to make a helper for man. Not that he needed to make animals and then search through them for a helper. He already had made them. He looked for a helper but could not find one. (This stuff would be so much easier to explain in person.:))
fact_143	fact	"No. Unless you wish to actually undertake the study of the relevant science, that's what you need to do.

fact_1251	fact	You would have been better served researching the scientific method directly. A branch of science is any field of study to which the scientific method is applied.  My OP critique of the work produced by the ID movement was deliberately philosophy-agnostic. After all, so long as the science done is rigorous, it matters not at all what inspires one to pursue a study in the first place. The religious motivation behind the ID movement is only significant in the larger context.  What they've got right is their deduction that they need to find something that can't have evolved in order to infer design. What they get wrong almost immediately is their belief that irreducible complexity represents an impossibility for evolutionary processes.

fact_1286	fact	"Well not to the pro-life league.  Remember the Unborn Victims of Violence Act passed by the senate after laci peterson? or as they call it, conners law?  The UVVA creates a federal law making it a crime to cause harm to a ""child in utero,"" recognizing everything from a zygote to a fetus as an independent ""victim,"" with legal rights distinct from the woman who has been attacked.  ""More than 30 states already have similar laws on the books. In practice, these laws treat the pregnant woman as little more than collateral damage in an attack portrayed to the public as one directed against the fetus.""  See, this law has nothing to do with prosecuting criminals who attack pregnant woman, it is about turning pregnant women into criminals.  Why do i say that? Lynn M. Paltrow, executive director of National Advocates for Pregnant Women sums it up quite well:  *In 1984, South Carolina's Supreme Court created a state feticide law in a case where a man viciously stabbed his pregnant girlfriend, causing her, among other things, to lose her pregnancy. In 1997, South Carolina used this law against a pregnant woman, Cornelia Whitner, who was charged with failing ""to provide proper medical care for her unborn child."" Whitner had given birth to a healthy baby who tested positive for an illegal drug. Based on extrapolation of the state feticide law, Ms. Whitner was convicted of criminal child abuse. At sentencing Ms. Whitner begged for drug treatment. The judge responded, ""I think I'll just let her go to jail.""  *Regina McKnight was an indigent 22-year-old woman with a drug problem. She became pregnant and despite her problems had every hope of carrying her pregnancy to term, but the pregnancy ended in stillbirth. The hospital reacted not by offering her counseling or drug treatment, but rather by helping build a criminal case against her. Eventually she was convicted of murder.  The South Carolina Medical Association and other leading health groups concluded that there was no evidence that McKnight's drug use caused the stillbirth. Moreover, no one in this case, not even the prosecution, believed that McKnight had any intention of harming the fetus or losing the pregnancy. Had McKnight intentionally sought to end her pregnancy by having an illegal third trimester abortion, her sentence would have been two years in jail -- but because of a law similar to the bill President Bush just signed, she is today serving a 12-year sentence.  read more here   another good article on the matter:  Do pregnant woman have rights?  *In 1984, for example, a Nigerian woman pregnant and hospitalized in Chicago was forced to have a C-section. She refused the surgery because she planned to return to Nigeria where she would be unable to access C-sections for future births. The hospital obtained a court order and forced her to undergo the procedure. Hospital staff tied her down with leather wrist and ankle cuffs while she screamed for help.  *Another hospital obtained a court order to force a pregnant woman to undergo a blood transfusion. Doctors ""yelled at and forcibly restrained, overpowered and sedated"" the woman in order to carry out the order.  *In Washington, DC, doctors sought a court order to force Ayesha Madyun to have a C-section. The doctors asserted that the fetus faced a 50-75 percent chance of infection if not delivered surgically. The court, apparently viewing the pregnant woman as having no more rights than a slab of meat, said, ""[a]ll that stood between the Madyun fetus and its independent existence, separate from its mother, was put simply, a doctor's scalpel."" With that, the court granted the order and the scalpel sliced through Ms. Madyun's flesh, the muscles of her abdominal wall, and her uterus. When the procedure was done, there was no evidence of infection.  *Angela Carder at 27 years old and 25 weeks pregnant became critically ill. She, her family and her attending physicians all agreed on treatment designed to keep her alive for as long as possible. The hospital however called an emergency hearing to determine the rights of the fetus. Despite testimony that a Cesarean section could kill Ms. Carder, the court ordered the surgery because the fetus had independent legal rights. As a result, Ms. Carder not only lost her right to informed consent and bodily integrity; she lost her life. The surgery resulted in the death of both Angela and her fetus.  ""All of these women were denied the right to bodily integrity and physical liberty and their fetuses were granted more rights than any legal person under law.""  That line just about sums it up. These laws aren't about saving the unborn, and neither is the pro-life movement. It is about controlling and punishing pregnant woman. It is about taking rights away from the woman the moment of conception..as if she no longer exists. These people would not think twice about prosecuting a pregnant woman whos pregnancy results in misscarriage...intentional, accidental, whatever."
fact_147	fact	We've already been over this and again you're confusing two separate issues. I think everyone is agreed that people no matter what race are entitled to equal protection under the law.
fact_621	fact	"Mythic nonsense? It's historical fact. Or are you one of those ""The Holocaust never took place"" people?"
fact_635	fact	Yet, tehre seem to be people who remember taking the poll. Regardless, in his report it was a minor point. From a realistic standpoint, it took nothing away from the report when he removed it.   Lott was investigated for this, just like Bellisiles. He was not found guilty of any academic misconduct (unlike Bellesiles). When you consider the thousands fo data sets that he compiled to put that report together, the folks investigating him didn't think it was at all unbelieveable that he scoudn;t remeber the details of where that number came from.   Again, though, he ended up removing that number from his report (the single place that it appeared) and apologised for using it since he could not provide the raw data or a good cite for it.  Here is how he responded to the article you link to :  http://johnrlott.tripod.com/malkinsoped.html  It is rather interesting, and well documented. It addresses a couple of inacuracies in the article, such as the misconseption that he had attributed the disputed numner to Kleck.

fact_1735	fact	I believe such amendments cannot be pushed retroactively for them, so their marriages will stand (Something with US contitution code not allowing things like that to be retroactive).
fact_1053	fact	Yea I agree with you on how there was no exact se t of laws at the beginning of creation. The reason I say that they most likely didn't marry their sisters is mostly cause God gets mad at Cain and places a mark on his head so everyone he runs across will not kill him unless they want to die a death 10 times worse than his. Kinda just says that there are other people out there.

fact_2200	fact	So? The majority of most people aren't criminals, and follow most laws. How is this different?
fact_386	fact	Yes I do understand this. But you must admit that the instantaneous formation of a living organism, even an extremely primitive one, complete with the complexity of the DNA code as a result of random encounters of atoms and molecules is a little too much to buy. There is evidence right there for creationism. Only intelligence could have formed such an elaborate complex system for the structure of life and its propagation.
fact_392	fact	Nope. It was Darwin. There are letters in which Darwin proposed his theory to friends as early as 1844. Several of the leading scientists of Darwin's day were aware of his theory.

fact_1090	fact	Private property rights are the most fundamental of all rights and the basis for any government at all. When a society ignores those basic rights it ceases to be civilized and diminishes to tyranny, anarchy and crime. Previous societies have always used criminals to encroach on property rights and deprive the people of fundamental rights of any kind. When people cease to have dominion and exercise rights to protect that property by any means possible there is tyranny. There is no rule of law in the UK any more.  BRITAIN is there! Proud to have broken those ties back in 1776 :) emoticonXBye
fact_379	fact	The only arguement I hear from these links against embryonic stem cell research is that, in ten years, it hasn't yielded sufficient results for human trials. If that is your only arguement against its scientific viability then it is a weak one. Many technologies, biological ones included, can take a long time to develop.   Certainly, the adult repair stem cells that are mentioned in your articles may have their uses and sound as if they also deserve research money. However, one cannot just listen to one side of the story to make a decision. The scientists researching repair stem cells, patients who benefited from them, and doctors who use them are obviously going to sing its praises when it does introduce some gain. However, the embryonic stem cells might have even more potential, given the time and money to develop the technology.  So, unless you can show me evidence that embryonic stem cells will never achieve their potential or that repair stem cells can achieve everything that embryonic stem cells are hoped to achieve, then your arguement against embryonic stem cell research continues to be unconvincing.
fact_1084	fact	Armour piercing ammo, 100% legal. Here is where you can buy SS109 armour piercing ammo: http://ammoman.com/   I agree, the Brady Bill is laughable to criminals who want the contraban items. You do not even have to buy them, you can make them yourself.   I agree that the cops are not the best protection. The best protection is YOU for YOURSELF. Only you are on the spot the quickest when you are threatened. Only you are able the judge quickest weather your saftey is threatened. Seach on any engine: police accidental shooting. It is quite alarming how many times cops shoot the innocent. If cops can get to a crime scene in time, they have to sort out the criminal and the victim very quickly under difficult conditions. In essence, they do not get the whole story, until it is over. You may even gen a criminal pretending to be a victim, only to shoot the cops in the back. That is why victims at the crime scene are the best judge of who needs to be shoot first.  For my own personal situation, I do not recommend just buying a gun for protection. Also seek training and lots of it. Then practice, practice, practice, and then practice some more. No matter how justified you are defending your life with firearm, you must still defend your actions in a court of law, especially if human life was taken.  I do not agree with people carrying firearms with no training. That is a very personal decision and I will not stop anyone from carrying a firearm if they choose to do so.
fact_423	fact	"No, they are the same. God diliberately kept information fro them because He knew they would not understand, just like you would deliberately keep information not pertinent to you children because they will not understand. How we came about wasn't as pertinent as why and who, so thats what He told us. It could kinda be like the stork. You know your kids won't understand (and don't yet need to) about sex and child birth, so when your five year old comes up and asks where do babies come from SOME parents (not all, I know I won't, but SOME do) say that the stork brings babies. They put a myth in place of a fact that the children don't need to know. Furthermore, even if God did explain evolution, if the men He explained it to didn't understand. Which they probably wouldn't have seeing as they had no sense of time, biology, genetics, or even basic anatomy (all pertinent to evolution) then they would have transcribed something VERY different. If God told them ""In the beginning I created the Heavens and the Earth in the first billion years, I said let there be light and I caused a tiny powerful ball of matter with an enormous mass to explode and with that came the heavens and the Earth. At first the Earth w"" Lets see primitive man wouldnt have understood 'billion years' 'tiny ball of matter with an enormous mass' 'explode.' So what do we have left. ""In the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth, He said Let there be Light and there was."" I know that isn't the Bible verse, but do you see my point. Even if God didn't as you say 'diliberately' (which in my opinion implies malice, but you may use that word in reference to God if you wish to do so) keep the information from us. In the minds of man it could have been simplified enormously to a point of mythological proportions. A modern day example would be the theory of relativity. Have you ever had it explained to you. I have. It is extremely complicated and few people REALLY understand it. Anyway, when my father explained it to me when I was about 16, we talked about it for several hours (literally) and through all his complicated explanations and answers to my questions, my brain pretty much reduced it to ""As you approach the speed of light time slows down compared to things not going that fast. But that does not mean when you slow back down you will not return to their same 'time.' Time IS relative."" Now I still don't understand how time is relative or how time would slow down as you reach the speed of light, or even how you would return to their same 'time.' I can simply regurgitate the facts. Man back then wouldn't have understand evolution so it would have been simplified similarly. Simplify it to just the facts, ignore the how and put it into a time frame that you can understand and thats good enough."
fact_1912	fact	Because bibliolaty doesn't equal Christianity. There are two issues here:  1) many may worship Christ through analysis of sources of his life and/or the inspiration of the holy spirit without believing all of the Bible is valid in any sense  2) many who do accept the totality of the Bible as meaningful are aware of the huge amount of metaphor, poetry etc. in it. Is everything to be seen as from God's point of view? Are the Psalms and Song of Solomon not powerful and illuminating human expressions of love and faith?

fact_351	fact	To a small extent, this happens already. Oftentimes (21.3%, U.S.), a woman decides to have and abortion because she cannot afford a baby (from here, source). This is in effect removing members of society who are non-productive (babies produce virtually nothing useful until they mature by about 10 years). And poor families are less productive, since they are often on welfare.  Granted, this is a rather harsh perspective, but the effect is the same: In the U.S., there are about (21.3% X 1.31 million) 280,000 less people every year who would have likely grown up in a poor home (assuming the child wouldn't have been adopted). Forced contraception/abortion is seen as an effective way of solving poverty in some parts of the world...

fact_2348	fact	While that may be true for some - perhaps even many - I was just responding to the OP. That said, I think it foolish to claim/believe that the bible is all wrong. I consider myself an atheist, but I fully recognize - and expect - that much, perhaps even most of the events mentioned in the bible actually occurred. I do, however, also realize that the books of the bible were written at a much different time, that even real events were likely embellished, in some cases to the point of absurdity (knocking down walls with great shouts and the like...). Although I do not and will not pretend to be a biblical scholar or historian of any sort, it seems to me that the bible could be seen as a biased, mythology-laden chronicle of the history of a particular group of people. Interesting historically, but not very reliable as a guide to the true events of the time, and even less so for a guide to moral behavior and describing a Universe-creating Deity.

fact_1133	fact	the fact that the world is governed by laws of logic is exactly what eliminates god. since logic exists, god is not needed.  i suppose you assume that logic needs an intelligent initiator of some sort in order for it to exist? why? logic dictate that adding quantity causes that quantity to increase. this would occur with or without god's existence and needs no devine intervention to be consistently true. logic dictates that a system in equilibrium has a total of equal opposite forces and that the sum of all the forces in the system is 0. this is not contingent on god's presmce either. the more explanations of phenomena that can be logically explained, the less god is needed.   god and logic are indirectly proportionate. an increase in logic causes a decrease in god

fact_2412	fact	What are you talking about here? please be specific.
fact_2406	fact	first of all, the claim is that random changes in molecules do not produce bodiliy structures. Proteins are molecules and are thus not what I was referring to. Second, there are no new enzymes or new proteins produced by any mutations...and not only that but none of those mutations have been shown to be random. So for all the billions of bodily structures in the world, ToE cannot account for even ONE of them.
fact_71	fact	Again, true. But that doesn't take into account that there are two populations under consideration.
fact_2360	fact	"You mentioned here that same-sex marriage may have benefits which outweigh its ""abnormal"" nature. I must point out that even if we consider it abnormal, there is no reason to suggest that abnormal is somehow bad. In a free and equal society, abnormal deserves all the rights and privleges thet normal receives. Any benefits that exist in allowing same-sex marriage aren't being weighed down by abnormality.  [QUOTE]The concept of equality is a lot easier to conceptualize than to put into practice. We, as a society, preach equality in principle, but practice inequality in all aspects of our lives. As I mentioned above, the tax code is a great example of institutionalized inequality. Businesses practice institutionalized inequality daily. For example, I am considered, by my employer, to be an HCI (highly compensated individual). As a result, I pay a much higher rate for the same healthcare coverage that my fellow employees get. Is that fair? I guess as I get older, I worry less about abstract concepts that sound good in theory but don't exist in practice.[QUOTE]  Well, I won't argue that we will never be truly equal, and I won't argue that equality is the answer to everything, but I will argue that equality is worth striving for and that equality does exist in practice, it is just so ingrained into our mindset that we forget it is there. Compare US law to the laws of Europe before the revolution. In Europe there existed classes of nobles with extra rights under the law as well as kings and royalty with even more rights. As you went higher up in class, you'd get more and more political power. In America, we all have one vote. We all have an equal ability to participate in government. It is true that we use that vote to choose someone to make decisions for us in the government, but our ability to participate in government set a new precedent in equality. Consider even slaves or women's rights. These are cases where equality won out not just in theory but in practice. I will admit that we cannot simply just make everyone equal in every way, but we do our best to give them equal rights and equal represenation. In the case of same-sex marriage, I can think of no reason why we should not extend the same rights that opposite-sex couples have to same-sex couples (and plenty of reasons why we should)."
fact_580	fact	So it's not about what's scientifically correct - or in other words, the real natural history of earth as determined by multiple independent avenues of scientific endeavour.

fact_1682	fact	Well, yeah, of course. Put some DNA in a dish and it won't do very much at all; it's not exactly news that the surrounding developmental machinery is significant too. We're just in the process of establishing to what degree that machinery is 'general purpose', and to what degree it encodes specific traits.  The rest of your post just goes completely off the rails. Nowhere does the article mention DNA (or anything else for that matter) being designed to suit the purposes of the organism, so I'm not sure why you're getting so excited.
fact_219	fact	Well, the first part is true but I'm not sure I understand what you are saying in the second part. Science does not claim that intelligent design is false because science lacks the tools to examine the concept. ID is just another unsupported assertion outside the domain of science (and logic for that matter). ID has reached the stage of unsupported assertion without evidence. Science has better explanations.
fact_1696	fact	Incorrect.       Evolution is not something that must be adhered to. It is a scientific theory. As such, if evidence was brought to light that evolutionary theory couldn't account for, then the theory would be altered or scrapped. It's really quite simple.
fact_1866	fact	Yes, it recognizes there will be religion in our country, it allows all to follow which ever religion suits that individual as long as it does not impose upon others who do not follow that religious system.   Our constitution allows for dissent, opposition and opinions. It actually requires such dissent in order to come to conclussions which would serve everyone equally. If for some reason there is a practice which excludes certain individuals from the protections of the law, then it needs to be challenged.

fact_796	fact	perhaps we should read the first amendment again. Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion (and other stuff, but that's all that pertains to religion). It means it shouldn't single out a religion. It shouldn't teach something just because it's religious, but it also shouldn't not teach something just because it's religious. Making a law banning the teaching of abiogenesis and ID as hypothesies would violate the first amendment because the only reason we would be banning it would be because of the establishment of religion.

fact_782	fact	"That's why I voted as I did as well. Ideally I'd prefer the ""none required"" policy."
fact_2162	fact	"Not necessarily. When ""life"" begins is irrelevant, because flowers and weeds don't have rights yet they are a life form. The thing that determines rights is intelligence. Not how much or how little, but whether someone has it at all. A spec of dirt has no intelligence. It won't pop up and say ""hey! How ya doin!"" unless you're on crack. We've actually killed intelligent entities for less than the consequences of carrying out an unwanted pregnancy. We hunt, and we go to war. Even though I do not agree with war, I do agree with hunting, and I myself hunt on occasion. However, that is off topic. The point is, carrying out an unwanted pregnancy can have devastating effects, and those next 18 years could hold her back from her life. Its awful how she will have to liver her life. If she gets an abortion, the embryo does not (to quote another opinion) ""mentally exist"". Now, hunting is really only done for recreation, and maybe a good meal. They would've been almost just as well off if they went to the local taco bell. Sure, they'd prefer hunting, but its really only done for fun and exercise. I, myself, value an animal over an embryo at its current stage. The only reason I don't completely think an animal is worth more is because that embryo has a chance of becoming a human. Then again, the animal does mentally exist and has full awareness, and the embryo is really just a sitting cellular watersack with no organs."

fact_1494	fact	Actually, there are three different definitions of biological evolution. Each of them is understood by biologists in its context without any need to elaborate. Each of these definitions are, of course, distinct and separate from other definitions of the word.  For example, your definition #1 isn't one of those definitions. Even though you begin with a claim about honest definitions of biological evolution, your first definitions isn't one of them. It is, in fact, more like the Victorian definition of the word than what it has come to mean today, and certainly not relevant to any biological definition. Your definition #1 is the reason that Darwin objected when the term was applied to his theories. It isn't what Darwin had in mind and it isn't what a biologist or anyone who understands biology means, even today. Either you don't know what you are talking about (most likely) or you are trying to raise a straw man (dishonest).  Of course, any fool can see that your definition #2 is circular. Stating that evolution is an evolutionary process doesn't actually define anything. While you object to embedding some undefined metaphysical postulate in a definition, you apparently don't have an objection to embedding the word itself in its own definition.  Would you like to learn about the meanings that biologists assign to the word evolution?

Your first opinion I can accept as your opinion, you are entitled to it.  Your second statement can be taken to mean that someone in a coma on life support is not 'residing' in the hospital room on the bed linked to life-support equipment, but rather that they are physically attached to it for their very survival. Or that an Eskimo is not 'residing' in an igloo in the Arctic with -60F temps and windchills of over 100F below zero... but that they are attached to that igloo for their very survival.

fact_1318	fact	"I think pro-gun extremists' stubborn and uncompromising opposition to even small amounts of gun control appears unreasonable to a lot of people and turns people against them. The pro-gun side plays a role in creating their own enemies. One example of this happening is the case of Sarah Brady. In her own words:  ""Dorothy and the manager of the company stopped by in their pickup truck with the idea that [we] would go swimming. Scott got in first, and I climbed in behind him. He picked up off the seat what looked like a toy gun and started waving it around. I took [it] from him, intending to say he must never point even a toy gun at anyone. As soon as I got it into my hand, I realized it was no toy. It was a fully loaded little Saturday night special, very much like the one that had shot Jim.  ""I cannot even begin to describe the rage that went through me. To think that my precious little boy, 6 years old, had actually held a loaded .22 pushed me right over the edge. I handed the gun to Dorothy. I didn't want to see it again, I saidâget rid of it. The manager made some lame excuse about how he had to have it for self-protection against union members. I didn't reply.  ""Days later Sarah heard a report that the National Rifle Association was pushing a bill known as McClure-Volkmer, which called for the repeal of a Federal gun-control law passed in 1968.  ""Instantly, all the fury that had hit me in the pickup truck came rushing back. I knew the 1968 law well. It was a sensible measure that essentially set age limits for gun buyers, imposed some I inspection and bookkeeping requirements on gun dealers and banned the import of Saturday night specials. I picked up the phone and called the National Rifle Association's Washington headquarters. I said, 'My name is Sarah Brady, and you've never heard of me, but I am going to make it my life's ambition to try to put you out of business.'

fact_3	fact	"No. We don't agree. For one thing your faith isn't a theory. Creation as described in Genesis is a myth, in fact, two myths. Furthermore, a scientific theory doesn't mean ""wild guess with no foundation"". That seems to be what you want the word to mean. In science a theory is an explanation for observed facts that has been tested. You see, a theory is predictive. I'll give you some examples of scientific theories. The germ theory of disease, the theory of gravitation, the heliocentric theory, tectonic theory, atomic theory.  Moreover, you are wrong that science cannot observe actual evolution of life. It is done all the time. While it may be debatable that a virus is alive, the recent case of SARS making the jump from civets to humans after a mutation is evolution."
fact_1330	fact	"Actually, that's not true. The standard upon which the ""super accurate atomic clocks"" are based is slightly different from the actual rotation of the earth. It is as if you had two clocks that kept time slightly differently. I have to adjust the time on my grandfather clock all the time - every time I raise the weights I reset it to the correct time. It used to keep pretty good time and require resetting only about every six months but it broke and I had to replace the works. It has taken a good six months to adjust the speed to the point that it is now off by only about a minute/week. I'm still adjusting.  That's what is happening with the ""leap seconds"" that occur from time to time. The adjustment is primarily to sync up two clocks keeping slightly different times, one of which is very accurate, the other of which varies and is slowing at the rate of 0.005 sec/year/year."
fact_1324	fact	I think this is a fair conclusion. I went as far as I did because of what it seems to say about the governor calling for a joint session. I may be wrong, but the text seems to instruct the governor to keep them in joint session until final action is taken. In other words, it doesn't appear that the governor has an option. And it does not seem that the Constitution allows for a legislative session that never ends. I'm not sure how else to square the two except that the legislature should pursue final action. Of course, as you have pointed out, it really is hard to speculate on this one without any historical context of the amended Amendment Process, and/or the relevant legal precedent surrounding it. Any thoughts on this?

fact_1683	fact	Well, that is a load of lots of misinformation, and some misconceptions.  The reason that we do have not observed any life coming from non-life is for several reasons. 1) the environment is changed. We no longer have a methane atmosphere that is full of organic matrials. 2) even if some did come, how would we know? If we came accross it, we would assume it was there for a long time.  You are incorrect about dating fossils. One way that fossils are dated is vis radiometric dating. I know answer in geneis has a lot of misinformation (and plain out lies) about radiometiric dating. Here is a link to a web site that explains it, and also answers the critiism of creationists http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/dating.html  We have seen 'answers in genesis' many many times. They make a lot of   invalid asserstoins, and basically are ignorant when ti comes to science.   Their main arguenent consist of misrreprenting the viewpoint of science,  the logical fallaciy of personal incredibilty, and the logical fallacy of the arguement from ignorance.

fact_595	fact	How are we now able to observe the orbit of Pluto, when the orbit of Pluto supposely takes 249 years? It was only discovered in 1930. According to your logic, any claims that Pluto orbits the sun is pure speculation and will be until 2179.  By the way, we observe evolution all the time. You see, the threory of evolution has to do with how living organisms change through time, not with how the world came about. We have observed the bacteria evolve to become resistant to antibiotics all the time. It is becoming a real problem in that there are some bacteria that are immune to almost every antibiotic we have.
fact_2413	fact	"Why do you apply the term evolution to these? Do you, deep-down, believe that these have resulted from evolution too? You are not alone in making evolution an absolute all-encompassing world-view... Oddly enough Close_slave_can denies that anyone does this.  ""Evolution is not alone in its naturalism. All science, all engineering, all manufacturing, and most other human endeavours are equally naturalistic. If we must discard evolution because of this philosophy, then we must also discard navigation, meteorology, farming, architecture, printing, law, and virtually all other subjects for the same reason.""  http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CA/CA601.html  However, the influence is not all one-way..  ""We live under capitalism, so we have capitalist science. We want to bring a different set of values into being, to bring about a new set of ruling ideasâideas of a society without rulers, a part of a different ideology or world-view. We want to bring about a socialist society. It will, if we are vigilant, have a socialist science. I can imagine it, or some of it.""

""In short, the triumph of Darwinism implied the death of God and set the stage for replacing Biblical religion with a new faith based on evolutionary naturalism. That new faith would become the basis not just of science but also of government, law and morality. It would be the established religious philosophy of modernity."" (Fr.

fact_1654	fact	"What you are talking about is irreducible complexity; it is the only argument against evolution that appears to be totally immune to rebuttal.  I have thought this issue is far over debated like gay issues but perhaps that are because I have an objectivist view point.   I don't suppose any evolutionist have realized that all the evidence for evolution is also evidence for ID.  They often talk about the mountains of irrefutable evidence, but the fact that the sun rose and set every day was evidence for the sun orbiting the earth, but it's also evidence for the earth spinning.  Likewise all the evidence for evolution can be condensed into one statement ""life forms are similar to other life forms"", This is predicted by the intelligent design hypothesis as well.  Direct evidence for ID that would not support evolution would be irreducibly complex biology, direct evidence for evolution that would not support ID would be more than just adaptation, it would have to be original useful DNA, or a simulation showing that coherent structure can be achieved without intelligent design by randomization and elimination."

fact_58	fact	"Not one that a solid case can be made for. If it happened they would be numberless just as Darwin said.  Dr. Colin Patterson, Senior Paleontologist of the British Museum of Natural History, in an interview on BBC television, said...  I mean the stories, the narratives about change over time. How the dinosaurs became extinct, how the mammals evolved, where man came from. These seem to me to be little more than story-telling. And this is the result about cladistics because as it turns out, as it seems to me, all one can learn about the history of life is learned from systematics, from groupings one finds in nature. The rest of it is story-telling of one sort or another. We have access to the tips of a tree, the tree itself is a theory and people who pretend to know about the tree and to describe what went on with it, how the branches came off and the twigs came off are, I think, telling stories  Storrs Olson, curator of birds at the National Museum of Natural History said:  ""The idea of feathered dinosaurs and the theropod origin of birds is being actively promulgated by a cadre of zealous scientists acting in concert with certain editors at Nature and National Geographic who themselves have become outspoken and highly biased proselytizers of the faith. Truth and careful scientific weighing of evidence have been among the first casualties in their program, which is now fast becoming one of the grander scientific hoaxes of our age---the paleontological equivalent of cold fusion."""
fact_1126	fact	Well, I just don't see this. It's an observable fact that species produce far more progeny than can possibly hope to survive. Consequently, the grim reaper will take most of them before they can breed -- which is NS in action. There is absolutely nothing implausible about variation being random, with only those variants that are compatible with environmental conditions having a chance of success. The rest you just wouldn't see.

fact_1907	fact	Actually quite incorrect. One of the signs that evolution by means of natural selection is occurring is when changes in genetic makeup takes place in randomly mating populations. It seems that you have been influenced by Hitler and his breeding programs.
fact_436	fact	Actually, the whole basis for modern science depends on the assumption that the universe was made by a rational creator. Dr Stanley Jaki has documented how the scientific method was still-born in all cultures apart from the Judeo-Christian culture in Europe (Science and Creation (Edinburgh and London: Scottish Academic Press, 1974)). An orderly universe makes perfect sense if it was made by an orderly Creator. But if there is no creator, or if Zeus and his gang were in charge, why should there be any order at all? Loren Eiseley stated (Loren Eiseley: Darwin's Century: Evolution and the Men who Discovered It, Doubleday, Anchor, New York (1961):  âThe philosophy of experimental scienceâ¦began its discoveries and made use of its methods in the faith, not the knowledge, that it was dealing with a rational universe controlled by a creator who did not act upon whim nor interfere with the forces He had set in operationâ¦ It is surely one of the curious paradoxes of history that science, which professionally has little to do with faith, owes its origins to an act of faith that the universe can be rationally interpreted, and that science today is sustained by that assumption.â  C.S. Lewis also pointed out that even our ability to reason would be called into question if atheistic evolution were true (God in the Dock (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 1970) pp. 52-53):  âIf the solar system was brought about by an accidental collision, then the appearance of organic life on this planet was also an accident, and the whole evolution of Man was an accident too. If so, then all our thought processes are mere accidentsâthe accidental by-product of the movement of atoms. And this holds for the materialists and astronomers as well as for anyone else's. But if their thoughtsâi.e. of Materialism and Astronomyâare merely accidental by-products, why should we believe them to be true? I see no reason for believing that one accident should be able to give a correct account of all the other accidents.â  Further more, on what basis can we study the world in any coherent way and come to sensible conclusions about it?
fact_1913	fact	"no it is not. Darwinists say that evolution happens by way of selection of random variants.....what I'm asking for is for science to make sure the variants don't arise nonrandomly. I'm looking for experiments on animals that rule out heritable, adaptive variation.  Here you go.  that's not a controlled experiment. try again.  How do you carbon-date a rock?  you don't...you break open the ""rock"" and carbon date the soft, flexible parts that somehow survived for 100 million years without turning to stone. (It would also help if you broke the big bones open and looked for such tissue...something science evidently never has done either until Mary S. did it a couple years ago.  Apart from the 'horizontally instead of vertically' part which I didn't understand -   I say new, beneficial traits arise across a given population at the same time because the traits arise from within each creature. Likewise genes may be transferred from one species to another horizontally, without selection.  âScientists pick holes in Darwin moth theoryâ by Robert Matthews in the Sunday Telegraph (March, 1999)  Nothing from the New York Times? I'll check this out though.  I'm not sure what you mean by the other side of the debate, though. ID? EAM? YEC?  anti-darwinian.  SS: Show me one instance of a genetic mistake (random mutation/copying error) that that created a beneficial body part.  What do you mean by 'part'? If you're asking for an example of a single mutation that created an arm or a leg where none existed before, then you're asking for evidence of something that the ToE in no way shape or form says is possible.   ok....I'll save that.  Sickle-cell is a pretty good example, though, if you're prepared to accept blood as a 'body part'.   I'm not....besides, sickle cell adds nothing benefical in the way of phenotype. We've been over this here. Have anything else?  Strictly speaking, accumulation of mutations alone isn't what creates a new species; so long as a species interbreeds well,   well since you can't show me one case of speciation, with backup that the old and the new species can't interbreed and produce viable offspring, we'll just assume that it can't be done at all.  SS: Show me one instance of a mutation that formed a new organ or limb.  Not possible, and not predicted or required by the ToE either, so it's a strawman.  cool, ok...we agree there. Do you think a mutation can create a partial organ or limb?...like say 1/100th of one -- and be selected for?  Pretty much every experiment ever carried out in a petri-dish; take your pick :) Also the revisited peppered moth experiment I linked to earlier.  those are not animals and it's not RMNS....it's simply a fluid, adaptive genome at work. If RMNS worked in the petri dish then it should work by way of controlled experiments on actual animals -- which ToE scientists refuse to do.  SS:  show me set of skeletons that transition from ape to man by way of small modifications.    I can show you skeletons showing the transition from ape ancestors to man, if that's any use?   yes, it is of use -- show me.  SS: Explain to me why we donât see humans or dogs or alligators with accidental wings forming. (If the possibility was there for random mutations to produce wings on reptiles or mammals in the past, then it should also be happening now.)    Oh dear; where do I even start?  Ok, look, the ToE doesn't say that the possibility was ever there for random mutation to suddenly make wings appear out of nowhere. It just doesn't.  Ha! do you agree that the first winged animals came from non-winged animals or not? If so, what's the difference?"

What is called the ""scientific"" approach is to analyse social statistics to derive probabilities, a methodology which assumes that the present is the same as the past, all well and good for the physical sciences, where the way particles behave does not change, but inappropriate in application to complex systems like people, that may react in ways totally unanticipated.  Not only is unpredictability inherent in such systems, but the more ways you try to manipulate them, the more uncertain the reaction to any particular intervention becomes.  So what do you do then, just take this method anyway, even given you can't predict the results, just take your best shot?

fact_185	fact	"I think reason why the ""hypothesis validated"" card has been played here is because:  1. The time window for the expected transitional form is about ~20 ma, a narrow window by geological timeframes. Given this the researchers examined the stratigraphic column to select locatities where the rocks were of the corresponding age and selected sites accordingly.  2. Tiktaalik was expected to live in a certain type of environment, and this expectation was used to further narrow the localities that would be explored as potential deposits for containing the expected ""transitional"" form.  3. Having selected the locality, expeditions were mounted and successfully recovered remains of the anticipated beastie. Upon analysis it was found to lie in terms of evolutionary development between the most derived/advanced fish and most primitive tetrapods that had been previously known.  Given the huge expanse of the Earth's surface 1 and 2 helped the researchers select comparitively tiny areas to examine and the fact they found what they (roughly) expected to find says their hypothesis (we will find remains of transitional form x at locality y) was borne out. If no remains had been found then further expeditions might have been successful and the hypothesis could of been validiated at a later date. If they had found, lets say a more primitive form than the previously most advanced fish or a more advanced tetrapod than the previously most primitive form then I think that might amount to a falsifiaction.  Having said all that I think that to claim a hypothesis was validated in this instance is slightly confusing as palaeontology is like archeology- you can never be 100% sure everthing has been found and one small discovery can force a rethink of what that had been established up to that point. Also, IIRC, none of the three articles in nature make any reference to a hypothesis being validated ;)  I'd describe it more as being an expectation being fufilled."
fact_2003	fact	You can't...only admin can...and there's no need to be sorry.
fact_813	fact	Yes it is, police aren't obligated by the US Constitution to protect individual citizens. If they were, lawsuits could be filed every time a crime is committed, and the police would go bankrupt really quick.
fact_1522	fact	And yet they also claim other reasons ... fraud and $, which I was addressing.
fact_1244	fact	You guys know me. Always happy to correct anyone.  As electrolyte pointed out, (1) the first step in the scientific method is the observation. A scientist observes something that raises a question. (2) Then comes the hypothesis, that is an attempt to explain the observation. The hypothesis can be an educated guess or even wild speculation based on previous knowledge or intuition, or it may be based in previous science and an understanding of scientific principles. (3) One then makes a prediction that is a necessary consequence of the hypothesis. That science is predictive is one of its salient characteristics. In the case of the scientific method, the prediction is said to have the power to falsify the hypothesis. In other words, if the prediction can be shown to be false, then the hypothesis must also be false. If the prediction is true, then the hypothesis is supported. So now we have the observation, the hypothesis that explains the observation, and a prediction that is a consequence of the hypothesis. The next step (4) is to design an experiment to test the prediction, and then (5) to perform the test. If the prediction fails the test, then it may be abandoned. However, as electrolyte pointed out, the process may be circular, because if the prediction is falsified, additional observation from the test may be used to adjust the hypothesis at (2), and a new prediction is made at (3), and so on.  In creation science, the process stops at (2), except that the hypothesis is based on dogma and scripture, not reality.
fact_1250	fact	"Well I replied to this same post a couple months ago, but I would like to respond with a new perspective I have on it now.  Basically the basics of the US government is that it is to secure our rights and our safety, so that we don't live in a state of anarchy, where the biggest strongest man wins. If a power isn't given to the government, they may not use it. The bill of rights is an even further prohibition of regulation. To make a law based on firearms or anything they have to have a reason for doing it, and the federal government may not be involved unless the Constitution grants them the right to (it doesn't mention guns in the powers it gives the US government). The 2nd amendment is restricting the government (federal, states, and local governments) from infringing upon that right. But the question still arises, what is meant by the mysterious militia clause?  There are many interpreations on this but I think the basic meaning of this is so that a similar thing could happen as did in the American revolution. But then an even bigger problem arises. If that purpose is to be left intact we need to allow the citizens to access the same weapons the government has. But I really don't feel comfortable allowing citizens with atomic bombs and such. This is really a problem. Also, obviously if this were meant to be a tool for a revolution, wouldn't concealed weapons also be covered? Again it seems that it is currently impossible to follow the intentions of the amendment.  Many will use the quote ""Those that sacrifice liberty for safety deserve neither"", but this is a hollow argument. The whole purpose of government is that we give up some of our natural liberties (the liberty to kill someone) for personal safety and protection of our other rights (the right to life). I agree you cannot go too far, but where do we draw the line? I don't like the idea of an oppressive government owning all the weapons or do I want them available to the worst criminals, so that instead of handguns and regular bombs, they are using uzies and atomic bombs? Do you have more trust in the government or in the general public? That's a hard question to answer because I don't have much trust in either one, therefor I seem to be undecided on where to really draw the line. As you can see, my opinion on this matter has changed drastically over the past few months, mostly because of this site (see, ideas really can change minds :)), so please don't tell me how I'm contradicting myself here."
fact_807	fact	Yes yes, this was all covered in Wells' previous book, Icons of Evolution. It has been refuted numerous times (some even on this forum). See here for a thorough debunking.
fact_1536	fact	"I'll address the later question. They may not ""need"" teeth that big, I couldn't say. Just because a creature has a feature doesn't mean its necessary or useful. While evolution does select for useful traits and against harmful traits, that doesn't mean that a trait won't develop that is simply odd. As long as it isn't particularly negative there's no reason to assume it will go away, and so sometimes you get traits that aren't ""useful"", they're simply not harmful. Those teeth could be such a case."
fact_1246	fact	"Yes. We all ask this question of creationists who propose that the universe was created out of nothing - poof! But science doesn't try to answer that question. We do know that the universe began expanding about 13.7 billion years ago. What went before that and the cause for the expansion isn't known and at present, and may never be knowable. However, we do know that particles can and do spring into existence from nothing, for no apparent reason. Google ""Casimir effect"" and read about one example. Wikipedia will probably be the 3rd entry. This something from nothing is an effect from the zero-point energy of a vacuum."

fact_1520	fact	"They used to keel over regularly before modern medicine and my wife has been on medication for a thyroid condition ever since she delivered.  ""During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, between 1 percent and 1.5 percent of all births ended in the mother's death as a result of exhaustion, dehydration, infection, hemorrhage, or convulsions. Since the typical mother gave birth to between five and eight children, her lifetime chances of dying in childbirth ran as high as 1 in 8. This meant that if a woman had eight female friends, it was likely that one might die in childbirth."""
fact_811	fact	No, there isn't a consensus among Christians, at least not beyond the fact that God was responsible in one way or another for the universe existing. There is no consensus about method.
fact_1534	fact	It is not speculation. When the 2nd Amendment was written, modern military weapons were flint lock rifles. The whole purpose of the 2nd Amendment was so common people could fight off a state armed with modern military weapons.  Today the weapons have changed, but the need or the intent has not.  The 2nd Amendment does not mean we fight a tyrannical government with flint lock rifles.
fact_805	fact	"Certainly science has provided part of the answer with their finding of the Mitachondrial ""Eve"", suggesting that one person can have all the DNA necessary for all the variation in human populations.  One of the standard rebuttals you hear is ""How did the Kangaroos get to Australia""? I don't know if that's covered in the Bible... if God transported them or not."
fact_1252	fact	I believe he refers to the fact that the morning after pill will keep a fertilized egg, if there is a fertilized egg, from implanting (which 60% don't on their own anyway but..). To the delusional, that's an abortion.  Besides, the restriction is that no military funding, or health facilities can be used to perform an abortion. A pharmacy is a STORE.
fact_193	fact	Some of them know (from experience, because many nutjob anti-evolutionists are positively dishonest -- like Mathis & Co.) that statements have to be phrased carefully for at least one of (at least) two reasons: First, these people know a sh*tload less about the technicalities than the interviewers do; second, words may be chosen more carefully to try to prevent snippets being used out of context. You can see both in this instance, with the explanation of one postulation involving crystals and Dawkins referring to the ultimate Darwinian development of any theoretical panspermia initiators (which got cut off to be spun into a ridiculous quote mine).
fact_2015	fact	Scientists do not want to (and/or are not allowed to) do experiments on animals that will kill some of them. All of the evidence that you will find will be based on experiments that do not harm animals (except, of course, for insects).
fact_2001	fact	No. You've not understood what I said. I don't know how to make it perfectly clear to you...the reason the skin color vs. homosexuality analogy is not valid is that one is in 100% of the cases studied a result of uncontrollable genetic inheritance and the other is generally not.
fact_1508	fact	I will let Peeling address this. But seriously, do you truly believe that scientists are this great cabal whose ultimate purpose is to steer the political process in a more liberal direction? To what end? Are conservatives more unwilling to fund science, is that your point?
fact_839	fact	THE STATE v. BUZZARD.  Buzzard decided 2:1 to uphold a law restricting concealed carry. But had the question been is there an individual right o keep and bear arms for one's own protection, the court would have split 2:1 in favor of that right. So your mention of that case makes little sense if you are trying to make the point that Heller was not true to precedent. Heller was not about concealed carry, but rather the RKBA for self defense  Of the 3 judges, only Dickensen interpreted the RKBA as did the dissents in Heller. Dickensen read the RKBA as a limited individual right to keep and bear arms for the protection of the state (a right which does not encompass self defense).
fact_187	fact	Will it be 100% legal for you to carry a gun?  If the answer is yes. Then so what? So what if people react with panic? If you are 100% legal, then it is your right to carry a gun. Your rights are just as important as thiers.  I was once reported by a woman at a gas station for carrying a gun. I was not carrying concealed. I was very professionally dressed and driving a very yuppie car. When the cops came by, I was not the one the cops were XXXXXX at.  BTW before the cops arrived I had removed the pistol from my hip and placed it in the glove box.
fact_1285	fact	maybe firstly you should explain how god works? In what way does he manupilate matter in defience of the laws of physics, where does he dwell, how can we not observe such a being? And all the other questions of the supernatural. The theory of a god is actually a lot, lot more complicated than evolution as you have to explain *how* God works to get even basic science points.
fact_178	fact	Humans cannot cleanse themselves of their sins.
fact_1291	fact	I think the real question is not detaching but killing. You don't detach a fetus during an abortion..you just kill the fetus (or embryo) and suck it out. I am not sure Tom is for any of that.  But if Tom would die, then no...Bob has no right to detach...in fact, probably no right even if he wouldn't die.
fact_150	fact	"You think wrong. Just look at most places in Scandinavia. They are much freer in thier atitude towards sex and they don't have nearly the the problems as you do.

In the case of many places in the USA it is sort of like ""A little knowledge is a dangerous thing..."""
fact_636	fact	Actually, one. After the adoptions years ago, we hit the financial slump and had a suprise... The costs will extremely low. I've also been in discussion with numerous friends who've delivered, same story. Somehow, no matter how there is no money and no help, babies get born.   And as I've said, there are plenty of organizations that will cover all costs finacially in cases of adoption.
fact_622	fact	"This stat sounds more than a bit inflated. Seeing as it comes from a website called ""women's issues"" it is probably not all that credible."
fact_144	fact	You're missing the point. The ghetto resistance was drastically outmanned and outgunned, and it still took the professional, well armed German military, nearly a month to beat them down into defeat.
fact_1722	fact	Pretty good considering Darwin wasn't aware of genetics. Too bad Wells is stuck in 1859. The modern synthesis provides perfectly legitimate mechanisms.
fact_1044	fact	"Neutral? One of the main standards and reference points for science and evolution on the internet is talkorigins.org. It's promoted as an educational site - a place with answers to criticisms of the evolutionary theory. It's every bit as biased as AnswersinGenesis, yet in many cases it's difficult for ID proponents to target. Part of the broad definition of evolution is microevolution, about the only segment of the broad term that is provable. They can masterfully employ that to make an ID proponent appear uninformed or irrational if he questions happenstance orignis, or other unproven evolutionary assumptions. They make their atheism clear in many ways however. They devote a page to comment about the ""International Flat Earth Society"", pretending they believe it to be a legitimate site. Almost any rational adult can see that it's phony. (Wikopedia calls it a hoax) There's nothing neutral, or even agnostic, about that site, and it appears to represent the anti-ID-in-schools mindset to a T. If there's actually a more neutral, agnostic, scientific website that opposes ID being taught in schools, I'd like to see it."
fact_1050	fact	"Certain people include the big bang in the ""general theory of evolution"". This is the statement I made and it is a fact and not ridiculous. I did not discuss the truth of the statement I made the comment the statement is made."
fact_1736	fact	An amount of violence miniscule in comparison to the violence caused by Christians intolerant of other religion; look to the Crusades and the Inquisition if you please. Look at the justification for the slaughter of Native Americans. Look even today at the ruthless murders of gay people.  But just as I would not judge all Christians by the actions of some, it is inappropriate to judge all evolutionists by the actions of some.  Overall, I don't think this author brought up any legitimate point against evolution except for the lack of transition species, which is an interesting topic in itself.  However, if the author had proven that the world is young, the most logical explanation would be that evolution occurred in a shorter span of time, for all of our scientific evidence points toward evolution. If the author had proven that evolution hadn't occurred, then the most logical explanation that some similar, natural process is the cause. But it is a great leap of faith to suggest that Creationism is correct.  See, the author has made a mistake fatal in debate: he has attack his opponent's viewpoint, then stated that since his opponent is wrong, he is correct. But that is not true, for he has not provided any reason for us to believe that he is correct.  I, for example, might be contending that a bunch of Vampires carried stones together to form the Earth, then used their magic powers to make those stones into our world today. I could have then stated exactly all of the things this author stated, only replacing those Biblical quotes with writings about Vampires, and I could have come to the same conclusion. Since the evolution is wrong, then I am right.  But that's just not good enough. Even if he had proved evolution were wrong, there is no more reason to believe in the supernatural than there is to believe in Vampires, Dragons, Pixies, or any other mythological creation. This doesn't mean that those things don't exist, just that there is no reason to believe in them.
fact_2217	fact	Actually, it makes sense only to you. If you look at nature for just a little while, you willl become aware of a great deal of death. But it is mostly very economical since scavengers make sure that there is minimal waste.

fact_408	fact	Gee, gives the impression that Dr. David M. Raup, Curator of Geology, Museum of Natural History, Chicago, puts little stock in the fossil record and rejects evolution, helping support the preceding assertion that surely oneâs belief in evolution based on paleontology can scarcely be considered scientific.  But thatâs not at all what Dr. Raup was stating. While Googling for a fuller quote, I ran across a page that showed how this â and many other â statements by Dr. Raup were distorted by Creationists.   To start with, here is a fuller quote:
fact_1939	fact	"So now the definition of evolution is 'pre-existing genes switching on and off as needed for various environments?'  It is these kinds of articles that are so transparently silly that really irritate me.  An evolutionary mutation of a gene is: a new and useful gene that never b4 existed, bring new body structures and functions that never b4 existed.   Switching genes on and off is why built in redundancy has generated such a wide variety of creatures in such a wide variety of environments.  There has NEVER been 1 example of a newly created gene that provided a new beneficial function based entirely on new information forming on the gene.  The mutations are ALWAYS a net loss of information and as the genetic load continues - eventually all life will morphidite and die out.  The propaganda of the antibiotic resistant ""Superbugs"" was the biggest bunch of lieing nonsense of its time. There are still people who believe that too. They don't think - they believe."
fact_1087	fact	"The way it works in Kansas, the state board of education sets the guidelines and sends them out to all the school districts where they sit in a box in a closet somewhere. During much of the time when all this idiocy was going on, I was ON the local school board and had never once opened one of those books. We all knew they existed, and nearly half of us knew where ours were, it was just not something that anybody generally cares to look at. I would be shocked if you could find me 10 kids in the entire state who have ever read the state school boards definition of ""science"" or their guidelines. It is just not something that comes up.   IMO, that is why this issue came up in kansas. Our state school board here has VERY little power or control, so nobody really pays attention to them. When the first set of changes occured, there was a lag of about 6 months before anybody even realized it and then it was somebody from the media."
fact_1093	fact	"THE ONLY QUESTION ABOUT GUN REGISTRATION  by Alan Korwin  Dear Editor,  Only one thing is overlooked in the common-sense proposals to register guns, so here it is. How exactly would writing down my name, or your name, help arrest criminals or make you safer? Although at first blush, gun listing has a sort of tantalizing appeal, on reflection you have to wonder whether gun lists would be an instrument of crime control at all.  The unfortunate answer is that, no matter how good it feels when the words first pass your ears, registering honest gun owners doesn't stop criminals, and in fact focuses in exactly the opposite direction. It is an allocation of resources that has no chance of achieving its goal, if that goal is the reduction of crime.  1. Registering 70 million American households is extremely expensive.  Do you know what it takes to run a database that big? You need 19,000 changes daily, just to keep up with people who move every ten years. Floor after floor of cubicle after cubicle for employees with permanent jobs, payroll, parking and dry cleaning bills. It's a government jobs program all by itself, all in the common sense -- but deceptive name -- of stopping crime. How many criminals do you figure will register when all is said and done? That's right, none, and the planners know that. All that money and time, invested on tracking the innocent. That's why so many police departments are against it -- they'll be forced to run huge data centers with their limited resources, and hire clerks instead of cops.  2. Americans who fail to register would become felons without committing a crime.  Under registration, activity that is a common practice and has been perfectly legal since inception makes you a felon. Think about that. Possession of private property would subject you to felony arrest, if the property isn't on the government's master list. Boy, that doesn't sound like the American way. No other evil is needed, there is no victim and no inherent criminal act takes place. Paperwork equals prison. That's just wrong.  3. Registration, if enacted, will create an underground market for unregistered guns bigger than the drug trade.  How many times must an elite forbid what the public wants, before learning the unintended consequences of outlawing liberties? People get what they want either way, it's just a question of how much crime the government itself forces to accompany it. With respect to guns, the last thing you want to encourage is the creative import programs and price supports that drug dealers enjoy, for gun runners.  4. People have said to me, ""But Alan, if all guns were registered and there was a crime, then you could tell.""  Tell what? If your neighbor is shot, that's not probable cause to search everyone with a matching caliber in a ten-block radius. The evidence needed to conclusively link a person to a crime has no connection at all to a registration plan -- you need motive, opportunity, witnesses, physical evidence, the murder weapon. Police aren't waiting for official lists so they can start catching murderers. Gun registration schemes lack a crime prevention component.  5. You don't really think authorities would use gun registration lists to confiscate weapons from people, do you?  Despite real-life examples recently of exactly that in New York, California and Louisiana, and global history for the past century, this couldn't really happen, do you think? Who would even support such a thing in a country like America, with its Bill of Rights? The guarantees against confiscating property, unwarranted seizures and the right to keep and bear arms would surely forestall any such abuse of power. Are there really U.S. politician who would support firearm seizures? (Unfortunately, it's a long list of usual suspects.)  And what about the so-called First Amendment test? If it's OK for arms it must pass muster for words too. Why would an honest writer object to being on the government list of approved writers? Why indeed.  Pile logic on logic, some people just feel the government should register everything, just to keep control. When government has that much control, you no longer possess your liberties. You're living where government lists define who can do what, and where people control trumps crime control -- the gun registration model precisely. This form of ""gun control"" isn't about guns, it's about control.  I might favor registration if the system would include criminals. In fact, I'd favor testing the system on them first. But the U.S. Supreme Court, in a widely known case (Haynes v. U.S., 1968), had determined that a felon who has a gun cannot be compelled to complete such forms, because it violates the Fifth Amendment right against self incrimination. That's right, mandatory registration -- not in your case of course but in the case of a criminal -- is a self-indictment of a crime, and is therefore prohibited.*  Gun listing is a feel-good deception that passes unquestioned by the ""news"" media, engorges the federal or state bureaucracy, and undercuts the linchpins of American freedoms. It has no more place in a free society than a government authorized list of words, and should be rejected outright. Elected officials who promote such a scheme are opposing the very Constitution they take an oath to preserve, protect and defend, and deserve to be removed from office.  Sincerely,  Alan Korwin, Author  Gun Laws of America  * NOTE: This case only concerned a limited class of weapons, ""destructive devices,"" which are listed and tracked in a special federal registry under the National Firearms Act. Congress rewrote that law after Haynes to require only the legal transferor, and not the transferee, of such devices to file papers, and along with other clever changes this overcame the 5th Amendment problem. In U.S. v. Freed, 1971, the Court agreed the problem had been fixed (for possession of hand grenades by criminals in that particular case).  A general registration scheme would run into a greater problem. A prohibited possessor cannot have a firearm at all, so mere possession is a serious crime. An additional charge for failing to register the gun that can't be possessed would offend the 5th Amendment the same as in the Haynes case. However, possession of an unregistered gun by an ordinary citizen would turn that citizen into a felon, with no other illegal act but the paperwork failure. The innocent would have to register to remain legal, the illegal possessor could not register without violating the right to not incriminate yourself."
fact_434	fact	"So the argument there seems to be that gun crime has been rising despite the strict gun laws of England. The statistics show both a rise and fall in gun crime:  ""In the year ending 31 March 2005 provisional figures show a:  ""16% reduction in the use of handguns   9% reduction in robberies involving firearms   6% reduction in serious injuries from firearms offences   Despite these figures, the number of overall offences involving firearms has been increasing each year since 1997/98. And crime involving imitation weapons was up 55% in 2004-05 compared to the previous year. (Source: Crime in England and Wales 2004/2005)  ""Also of concern is a rise in the number of young people carrying real or imitation firearms in an attempt to boost their image or from a mistaken idea about self-protection.""  http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/crime-v...ime/gun-crime/  In addition, the rise in gun crime may be mostly due to the big rise in the number of replica and air guns being used in crime:  ""Imitation weapons were used in 3,332 offences in 2004/05, an increase of more than half (55%) from 2003/04....Ball-bearing (BB) guns are easy to purchase and often look like real weapons....Anti-firearms campaigners would like to see much tighter controls for all other types of weapons, including an outright ban on the production, sale, and possession of BB guns, airguns, and replica guns....The police say that in 2003 replica firearms were used in an estimated 60% of robberies and four out of five of all firearms offences. Nearly three quarters (72%) of firearms seized by the Metropolitan Police Service in 2003 under Operation Trident, set up to tackle gun crime within Londonâs black communities, were replicas, air guns, or starter pistols.""  http://www.crimeinfo.org.uk/servlet/...ory=factsheets"
fact_1905	fact	So what's the deal here? California won't even trust its own officers to do the concealed carry thing, and that's considered a reasonable way of doing things?
fact_352	fact	Actually, a few studies I've seen suggest exactly that. Looking at the birth rates among the various ethnic groups, and correcting for better birth control, etc, the rate actually remained fairly constant from before the Roe v Wade decision to the years afterwards. This suggests that the number of abortions remained fairly constant, they simply became legal to perform and recieve.  My feeling is, the desire and need for the abortion option has always been there. The legality will affect it, but not to a great extent.
fact_346	fact	And from this we are to infer that Leakey doubts human evolution? There is by now a huge variety of fossil hominids. If Leakey was admitting that it was difficult to be certain which were or were not directly ancestral to modern humans, this is no more than scientific honesty.

I think maybe the kids SHOULD be taught intellegent design as an example of pseudo-science. Hopefully they will see why it is not science and why evolutionary theory is.

fact_66	fact	I know this is an old posting, but I thought I would add to it. I have built several 1911 clones. Press forge the frame (and slide, sometimes), then mill the parts. I use a CNC mill (about $750,000). A lot fo guys, though, use a $300 minimill from harbor freight. A setup for press forging the parts (press forging is the better modern alternative to drop forging) will set you back less than $200, if you are a good scrounger.  Gun building is probably a more common hobby than you might think. It is hard to tell exactly how many people are doing it, because a homebuilt gun requires no registration, permit to build, or any of that other XXXX (unless you are building an NFA firearm, which is a machine gun). There is even a yahoo group about building your own gun. Fro the faint of heart (those who don't want to forge or cast theri own reciver/frame) there are a bunch of places that will sell you an 80% finished reciever, which doesn't count as a firearm from a legal viewpoint.   I always buy my barrels since it is too much work to do the rifling. In a pinch, it could be done, it just wouldn't be a competition grade barrel. Of course, most firearms you buy don't come with a stock competition grade barrel.

fact_1681	fact	Well, to keep it short, Iâll cite you to what I think are two of the best expressions of why the RKBA exists. The first was said by an Englishman named Andrew Fletcher, whose work was frequently cited by our founders to justify armed resistance against British misrule in America. The second was said by a Judge in my beloved Commonwealth of Virginia:  And I cannot see, why arms should be denied to any man who is not a slave, since they are the only true badges of liberty. . . .The possession of arms is the distinction between a freeman and a slave. He who has nothing, and belongs to another, must be defended by him, and needs no arms: but he who thinks he is his own master, and has anything he may call his own, ought to have arms to defend himself and what he possesses, or else he lives precariously and at discretion. And though for a while those who have the sword in their power abstain from doing him injury; yet, by degrees, he will be awed into submission to every arbitrary command. Andrew Fletcher, Political Works, pp. 35 and 221 (1749).   The right of self-defense is the first law of nature; in most governments it has been the study of rulers to confine this right within the narrowest possible limits...and [when] the right of the people to keep and bear arms is, under any color or pretext whatsoever, prohibited, liberty, if not already annihilated, is on the brink of destruction. Sir George Tucker, Judge of the Virginia Supreme Court and U.S. District Court of Virginia, in I Blackstone COMMENTARIES, Sir George Tucker Ed., 1803, pg. 300  There are many solid legal, moral, and practical arguments in support of private firearm ownership. Some are short, but many are long. I know quite a few of them, and Iâll happily share them with you if you want some more ammo for your debate. Just let me know here.  ---  False is the idea of utility that sacrifices a thousand real advantages for one imaginary or trifling inconvenience; that would take fire from men because it burns, and water because one may drown in it; that has no remedy for evils, except destruction. The laws that forbid the carrying of arms are laws of such a nature. They disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes. Can it be supposed that those who have the courage to violate the most sacred laws of humanity, the most important of the code, will respect the less important and arbitrary ones, which can be violated with ease and impunity, and which, if strictly obeyed, would put and end to personal liberty--so dear to men, so dear to the enlightened legislator--and subject innocent persons to all the vexations that the guilty alone ought to suffer? Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants; they serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man. They ought to be designated as laws not preventative but fearful of crimes, produced by the tumultuous impression of a few isolated facts, and not by thoughtful consideration of the inconveniences and advantages of a universal decree. Thomas Jefferson, Commonplace Book, 1774-1776, quoting 18th century criminologist Cesare Beccaria in On Crimes and Punishment, 1764  A militia, when properly formed, are in fact the people themselves, and render regular troops in a great measure unnecessary. . . .the constitution ought to secure a genuine and guard against a select militia. . .and include. . .all men capable of bearing arms. . . . But, say gentlemen, the general militia are for the most part employed at home in their private concerns, cannot well be called out, or be depended upon; that we must have a select militia. . . .[of the select militia] These Corps, not much unlike regular troops, well ever produce an inattention to the general militia. . .whereas, to preserve liberty, it is essential that the whole body of the people always possess arms, and be taught alike, especially when young, how to use them. . . .The mind that aims at a select militia, must be influenced by a truly anti-republican principle; and when we see many men disposed to practice upon it, whenever they can prevail, no wonder true republicans are for carefully guarding against it. Richard Henry Lee, Additional Letters from the Federal Farmer, p. 169-170 (1788)  Among the many misdeeds of the British rule in India, history will look upon the Act depriving a whole nation of arms as the blackest. If we want the Arms Act to be repealed, if we want to learn the use of arms, here is a golden opportunity. If the middle class render voluntary help to Government in the hour of its trial, distrust will disappear, and the ban on possessing arms will be withdrawn. Ghandi, 2 M. Gandhi, An Autobiography of the Story of My Experiments with the Truth, p. 374 (M. Desai, trans. 1927).  Whenever, therefore, the profession of arms becomes a distinct order in the state. . .the end of the social compact is defeated. . . .No free government was ever founded, or ever preserved its liberty, without uniting the characters of the citizen and soldier in those destined for defense of the state. . . .Such a well regulated militia, composed of freeholders, citizens and husbandman, who take up arms to preserve their property, as individuals, and their rights as freemen. M. T. Cicero (a pseudonym taken by a writer arguing during the constitutional debates), Charleston State Gazette, September 8, 1788  It has been asserted by the most respectable writers upon government, that a well-regulated militia, composed of the yeomanry of the country, have ever been considered as the bulwark of a free people. Tyrants have never placed any confidence on a militia composed of freemen. John DeWitt, The Anti-Federalist Papers, p. 75 (M. Borden ed. 1965)  Make mass searches and hold executions for found arms. V. I. Lenin, Collected Works, Vol. 35, 4th ed., p. 286. From Congressional Record, April 28, 1970, p. H3601.  If the opposition disarms, well and good. If it refuses to disarm, we shall disarm it ourselves. Joseph Stalin, Reply to the discussion on the Political Reports of the Central Committee, Dec. 7, 1927. Stalin, Works, Vol. 10, p. 378. From Congressional Record, April 28, 1970, p. H3601..  The most foolish mistake we could possibly make would be to allow the subject races to possess arms. History shows that all conquerors who have allowed their subject races to carry arms have prepared their own downfall by so doing. Indeed, I would go so far as to say that the supply of arms to the underdogs is a sine qua non for the overthrow of any sovereignty. So let's not have any native militia or native police. German troops alone will bear the sole responsibility for the maintenance of law and order throughout the occupied Russian territories, and a system of military strong-points must be evolved to cover the entire occupied country. Adolf Hitler, dinner talk on April 11, 1942, quoted in Hitler's Table Talk 1941-44: His Private Conversations, Second Edition (1973), Pg. 425-426.

You might as well ask for an example of a book or website on cosmology that 'admits' the sun may just be a big ball of fire pushed by a scarab beetle, and not a nuclear furnace about which the earth orbits.

Of course, what you are asking is if it has ever been observed that a frog turned into a lion. But that isn't evolution. In fact, a saltation (that is the word for that silly idea) would disprove the current theory of evolution. Organisms change only a little from generation to generation. Generally, evolution is a slow process since it happens in populations, not individuals. Evolution is a change in the genetic makeup of the entire population of over generations.
fact_226	fact	"You make an excellent point, Shooter.   While I don't feel the ""voter referendum"" idea should be abolished completely, there should be limits as to what should and should not ever be put to a simple majority vote, which I feel is like a state being able to cancel out the republican (little ""r"") concept upon which our country is wisely based and revert to mob rule.  Whatever the majority of a state's populace's preferences or prejudices, they should NOT be allowed to put up for majority vote issues that openly contradict that state's constitution, as interpreted by those they elected in the first place. (I'm speaking California here. I know in some states their Supreme Court judges are appointed--nevertheless, those that appoint them are elected.)  If they want to vote in new judges, fine. New legislature, fine. But once they've voted them in, I don't feel they should be able to go around, gather a few hundred thou signatures, put on the ballot an initiative to negate the rulings, and spend scads of money (mostly from out of state, yet!) to go ""booga booga"" to lie to, mislead and frighten people to overrule the decisions of the people whose legal knowlege and wisdom they voted to abide by in the first place.

fact_795	fact	"1. From what I have learned, different locations breed different surroundings. Human ancestors were migratory pack animals. Where they went, they encountered new types of pressures, causing them to change over time.  2. Different selective pressures. Different areas can lead to different pressures. Some mutations also occured etc. Things like that.  Evolution doesn't HAVE to occure non-stop if there is equilibrium. Not everyting is always changing, as far as I learned. Barring mutations that cause significant changes over a lot of time, Apes, Chimps, Monkies wouldn't really change all that much. There's no real pressure to do so. They are already well-adapted to their surroundings.  Actually however, there really isn't that much difference between some of the great apes and Humans. Take the Bonobo Chimps, for example. They have 98% the same DNA as Humans. They are the closest to HOmo Sapien.  3. Niches. Related to above. Crocs, for example, don't evolve that much because they are a very successful animal design and they found a place in which they can thrive for generations with little to no changes. Other animals can do the same.  4. As well, humans didn't come directly from Apes. We all evolved from a common ancestor who did all of the above.  http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/homs/species.html  Here is a time line of hominid species  http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/faq-speciation.html  http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/speciation.html  Evolution doesn't lead to a higher species, as well. There is no hierarchy in nature. Each species is equally as well ""evolved"" depending on it's environment etc.  A Human is no more evolved than a Chimp or better than a Chimp. Evolution doesn't lead to progression, but merely change. It's not getting better toward some high standard. Humans just like to think so."

That's all the court addressed. If they addressed anything else in the Heller case it would've been judicial activism, legislating from the bench.
fact_743	fact	Because of the rare nature of fossilisation, we don't expect to see perfect transitional lineages through millions and millions of years. I really don't think there are any scientists that think there SHOULD be millions and millions of transitions, because of the nature of fossilisation.  Science is like a detective story. If you wanted to solve a murder, for example, you take a look at the evidence. You have a gun, spent rounds, dead body etc. To convict someone of a murder, you need fingerprints, blood on clothes, DNA and such to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the person you are accusing actually shot the deceased and you can convict WITHOUT an eye witness.  It's the same for science and the fossil record, because there is no-one around who directly observed animals undertaking large changes over time. But if you take a look at the fossil record, molecular biology, geological time etc, this is what it shows. From what we understand from the last 100 or so years of evidence and investigation, biological evolution is the best scientific explanation we have for the diversity of life on earth.  3 questions for Calligirl.  For the 4th time. What would be YOUR definition of a transitional form?  When calculating the age of this earth, how precise do you expect or want scientists to get?  How many transitional fossils would you LIKE to see in what period of time?  I really don't think this will progress if you can't tell us what it is you would like to see.

fact_1496	fact	"No, it wasn't. Given the number of scientists one might assume that at least one would confuse his science with his religion. It seems that according to AIG, 182 actually do. I really have to commend AIG in that they did not list ""Dr."" Kent Hovind, ""Dr."" Carl Baugh, ""Dr."" Don Patton. However, the AIG does list Thomas Barnes who's highest earned degree is an MS in physics, his Sc.D being honorary from his undergraduate, Christian university. Clifford Burdick has a ""degree"" from a non-university (as described in the mimeographed bulletin of the ""University of Physical Sciences"", from which Burdick claimed his degree: ""'The University is not an educational institution, but a society of individuals of common interest for the advancement of physical science. There are no campus, professors or tuition fee.""). Harold Slusher has an honorary degree from a Bible college with only a 1/2 man graduate science department in addition to his ""degree"" from Columbia Pacific University a non-accredited correspondence school that promises a degree in less than a year. I do note that Clifford Burdick is listed on list of deceased scientists who believed in a creator.  I presume that the rest of the ""scientists"" listed by AIG actually have the PhDs that AIG claims of all 182 listed.  I invite you to compare that list to the Steve list, now at 720+ scientists named Steve who accept evolution as the correct explanation for the observed diversity of life. The name ""Steve"" (and variations thereof) comprises about 1% of the population. The percentage of qualified scientists with that name cannot be far from the norm. The Steve list was initially composed of scientists with PhD degrees biology, geology, paleontology, or a related scientific field. However, there are also scientists in fields such as cosmology and astrophysics that are signatories as well as other fields with an interest in evolutionary theory. For example, Stephen Hawking has signed the Steve list.  I invite you to find bogus and inappropriate degrees on the Steve list. I am sure that the NCSE would be appreciative of your efforts. Hopefully you will have a more difficult time than I did in identifying bogus degrees.  Oh, yes. In my experience, creationist scientists were always creationist long before they were scientists. On the other hand, there are lots of scientists who were once creationists, before they became scientists. As many polls have shown, the more educated a person becomes, the less likely it is that he/she is a creationist."

Mark 8: 31 And He began to teach them that it is necessary for the Son of man to suffer many things and to be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and to be killed, and after three days to rise again. 32 And He spoke the word openly. And taking Him aside, Peter began to rebuke Him. 33 But turning around and seeing His disciples, He rebuked Peter, saying, Go behind Me, Satan, because you do not mind the things of God, but the things of men. 34 And calling near the crowd with His disciples, He said to them, Whoever desires to come after Me, let him deny himself and take his cross, and let him follow Me. 35 For whoever desires to save his life, he shall lose it. But whoever shall lose his life for My sake and the gospel, that one shall save it. 36 For what shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world, yet damage his soul? 37 Or what shall a man give as an exchange for his soul? 38 For whoever may be ashamed of Me and My words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of man will also be ashamed of him when He comes in the glory of His Father, along with the holy angels.  Matt 26: 47 And as He was yet speaking, behold, Judas came, one of the Twelve. And with him was a numerous crowd with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and elders of the people. 48 And the one betraying Him gave them a sign, saying, Whomever I may kiss, it is He; seize Him. 49 And coming up at once to Jesus, he said, Hail, Rabbi. And he ardently kissed Him. 50 But Jesus said to him, Friend, why are you here? Then coming up, they laid hands on Jesus and seized Him. 51 And, behold, one of those with Jesus, stretching out the hand, drew his sword and struck the slave of the high priest and took off his ear. 52 Then Jesus said to him, Put your sword back into its place. For all who take the sword shall perish by a sword. 53 Or do you think that I am not able now to call on My Father, and He will place beside Me more than twelve legions of angels? 54 How then should the Scriptures be fulfilled, that it must happen this way?"

But it seems that creationists want to believe that all science is permanent and never changing. Thus, when re-evaluation of Kettlewell's work is done and flaws are pointed out, creationists loudly proclaim fraud and a victory for creation.

fact_0	fact	So penfold and brady you are in favour of denying citizens rights even though they have not been proved to have commited any crime? Ed Kennerdy was on that list so should he be discriminated against even though he has commited NO crime? What is next putting black people on the list purely because of the colour of their skin?   You sicken me you two. Why on gods earth would terrorists be buying civilian guns when they could just use AK47? Did you sniff petrol as a youngster as you seem to have.
fact_1455	fact	im not saying that my worldview is 100% provable because i live by faith but my faith is not blind, it makes sense to what we see in the world. However, if one examines the atheists worldview, it has lots of things that it cannot account for. All that exist is matter; do I excuse a rock for tripping me? They cannot account for morals. If morals come from man, then man can change them, if they come from majority consensus, it still begs the question is the majority right? The majority can change. If we are born with them, I could say, I was born to kill. (Animals do not have morals why should we?)
fact_964	fact	"LOL. ""Bats haven't evolved in millions of years""..."
fact_233	fact	And why do you say that in ancient times that atheists were people who believed in 'God(s), but didn't belive in intervention) (a.k.a Deists).      Why do you think that people who didn't believe in god exist?
fact_555	fact	This is a laughable oversimplication of reproduction. Humans don't make copies. Do you reproduce asexually? I know I don't.
fact_1864	fact	I believe there are a few fish that rely on electro magnetic fields to detect what is around them.
fact_541	fact	I know very little about evolution, but I think that the half ape thing stems from the misconception that some people have that evolution means that humans are decended from apes, so our ancestor would be a half man/half ape. Instead, I believe that biologists think that apes and humans share a common ancestor, but our evolutionary paths diververged long ago.   Please anyone feel free to argue/correct me, since I said, I am by no means an expert on evolution.

fact_98	fact	Since you redacted my previous statement, I repeat it for your benefit: There is nothing racist about the truth. Notice the underlying message in your posted article is about the Court of Appeals throwing her LAWSUIT out. That was the underlying agenda which motivated this racist jerk who also happens to be black. It is common of these people today to refuse to obey the law, then blame the cops for not allowing them to act like they do. Remember that it was she who was speeding in a school zone, then to refuse to give up her keys made her a public safety threat. She deserved what she got even though the thought of a pregnant woman being tasered is scary to me, she could have avoided it by cooperating with the police. I'm not pregnant and I would cooperate to avoid it. This is why I think she had other motives which makes her the lowest of the low since she was carrying another life within her.

fact_1680	fact	"While that definition of sin is true, the Hebrew definition means missing the mark. You could stretch it to mean unfit in English.  And you're technically wrong about the bible. Modernly it is one book, but bible means little books. For a time they were floating around in clusters. So academically they are self contained and unrelated. The apocryphal books are ""secret"" books. Religious scholars eventually decided they were just a bunch of stories, and most never made it in the bible. Look at Song of Solomon it made the cut, and people still have problems with it being put in, yet it conflicts with nothing."
fact_1694	fact	Basic law 101: You can drive by 15 1/2 with A LICENSED ADULT OVER 25 IN THE CAR. Not 18 or 21, but 25 so it isn't a matter of potential peers watching each other. And your opening post referred to 14 year olds or above, as it shows below.
fact_1119	fact	Well he HAS admitted he can't prove his belief. I guess that posting here would admit his false dichotomies that it's either literal genesis or evolution are false and god knows the world will end when that happens. Super admitting he's wrong?   Never going to happen.
fact_2410	fact	We can add to this list, Singin's desire of criminalizing gun owners who don't report gun thefts in a required time and to lock up all guns in a manner that will prevent thefts. He of course says that does not mean jail, but aiding and abetting and straw sales already require serious jail time. and straw sales is already a Federal Offense with either 5 or 10 year jail terms. So we are talking about Very Serious jail terms regardless of what Sinjin might say in order to sell the idea. And one more thing the Anti-gun forces want but won't say it now.

fact_582	fact	It's not part of any rhetoric--evolution is fact. It's no more rhetoric than gravity or the founding principles behind Newtonian Physics.
fact_2362	fact	But evolutionary theory doesn't claim that species arise in a single generation. How does it make your point to argue against claims that evolutionary biologists don't make? In fact, is it honest to misrepresent evolutionary theory?
fact_73	fact	You might want to pick up a history book and read it. Try reading both the Federalist and Anti-Federalist Papers for starters. If you were familiar with them, then you would've already had the answer to your first question.  Your selective memory is at work again. As I recall, in Waco military vehicles and equipment were used against the Branch Davidians. Nevermind the presence of members of Delta Force which was denied, at first, by the government. Then they were caught lying again about using flammable tear gas which, ironically enough, is banned by the Geneva Convention for use against enemy troops. In the end, the 'open and shut case' the government thought they had, blew up in their faces because of their lies and abuses. I also recall, at some point around the time of the Great Depression that U.S. troops were called out to quell food riots in New York, I think it was. There were a couple of young officers present by the name of MacArthur and Patton, I believe. There are a few other instances I'm sure.  I note your glee about secret agencies and their awesome firepower in which mere citizens would be defenseless against. Is your closet full of brown shirts? You must be proud.  Huh? You're for protecting yourself against other citizens as long as it doesn't involve guns? Of course, that wouldn't apply to the criminal that you're protecting yourself against! Why don't you read how well your gun bans are working in other countries? Regulation? The only regulation should be mandatory firearms training for all citizens like in Switzerland. Not the 'regulation' that you liberals would propose which, of course, always leads to an outright ban of private ownership. Why do you fear the 'people'?  It doesn't matter what you think, the second amendment is clear enough all by itself. Try reading the Constitution again.
fact_2404	fact	Because, when each is in its natural habitat, they are reproductively isolated.
fact_1125	fact	Try a new experience. Check these names from that list; David Catchpoole, Emil Silvestru, Gary Parker, and Carl Wieland. I found them quickly - there are probably others like them who were once atheists, who became scientists, and subsequently creationists.

fact_1657	fact	Well, that is PART of the Scientific Theory of Evolution. There is more to the Scientific Theory, such as adaptation to local changes in the environment and the ability to use new niches and so on.
fact_1131	fact	"You have not proven any lies....Sorry, you have not.  The studies were done in different countries.  AND, since the APA is now also reporting the lack of  genetic evidence, obviously there are no lies involved.  ARe you aware that in May of this year, (you should catch up) the APA has begun changing the language in their papers, related to therapies,  causes of homosexuality?  These are professionals, belonging  to the APA, including their former presidents and leaders...Sorry but you  are wrong, the paper includes studies from different countries  on twins, the facts are it is an ""environmental"" cause not a   genetic cause......that is what the studies are showing and even  the APA is beginning to change it their writing suggesting reparative  therapies will work, depending on the cause...  See this:  APA's New Pamphlet on Homosexuality De-emphasizes the Biological Argument, Supports a Client's Right to Self-Determination"
fact_347	fact	"Actually, the Second Amendment doesn't say anything about due process. It does not say that people on a terror watch list can not be prohibited from buying weapons, but the right can be infringed with due process of law. In fact, the Second Amendment says nothing about the circumstances under which it can be infringed. One scholar comments on the implications of this for the individual rights interpretation:  ""If read as an individual right, criminals, convicted felons, pirates, or revolutionaries could all be armed in the District of Columbia or in the federal territories. Pirates could load up their ships on the Potomac River and sail out to sea. Hunters could trample through Yellowstone or some other national park, guns in hand.[185] Anyone might board a plane, gun in hand, or carry a weapon into Congress, the White House, or any other federal building...  The Fifth Amendment allows the taking of liberty under some circumstances, while the Second, if read as an individual right, does not.""  Chicago-Kent Law Review  18th Century Pennsylvania, which had its own RKBA, passed a law which required citizens to take an oath of allegiance to the state or face being disarmed. This was to protect the state against those who might be loyal to the British Crown. So why can't the US take similar measures to protect itself against terrorists?"
fact_1910	fact	**  Here you reveal exactly what I've just spoken of--you assume that science and the scientific method equates to, is synonymous with, materialism/mechanism. It most certainly is not. Nor is the accompanying assumption, i.e., that any science which does not strictly adhere to materialust/mechanist assumptions, is not, and cannot be, real science. Equally untrue.  Both assertions are unnecessary to an objective approach to science, per se, but are part and parcel of an emotional defence of materialism/mechanism and its biological aspect, RMNS darwinism.
fact_421	fact	"And the mall plainly had ""no guns allowed"" signs displayed at all the entrances, meaning the shooter broke the law when he brought his gun in and started shooting.  Now, find me a school massacre that took place where concealed carry is actually legal on campus."
fact_1904	fact	Really, what is the materialistinc approach to which you refer (assuming you're also talking about 'pain')?      a) Is it strictly materialistic, or do they use non-material methods as well?   b) Can it be used to onbjectively measure pain?
fact_435	fact	The major problem is that Sodini and others IDed as CCW holders are in fact not permit holders. The media is just as guilty as these pervert organizations. Either they are totally clueless about firearms laws or they are out to carry the water for the pro slavery express. In Soldini's case the closest he came to being a CCW holder was he purchased the pistols legally. He neither applied nor was granted a carry permit. The same was true of the Michigan case. We have no friends in the leftist media much to our detriment. Remember blood sells and the more of it the better it sells.
fact_353	fact	Here in the Midwest, large numbers of diehard black Democrats voted for Kerry and against gay marriage. It truly was a cross-over issue that transcended party politics.

fact_1938	fact	"Well, PR on both sides will probably be gearing up on this, so which ever side does have the correct legal interpretation will probably be broadcasting it pretty soon now. It'll just be a matter of seperating the real answers from the bogus ones. Given how politcal the issue is I'm not going to accept any claims for correctness that don't cite actual specific law. As opposed, for example, to Romney simply saying ""the constitution says they gotta""."
fact_409	fact	"The documents contained in the bible are historical artifacts. They reflect the beliefs and values of the people who wrote them. When we read Paul we might not believe everything he says but overall we can believe that he preached a gospel that Jesus was born, crucified, died, and risen. We can discern his message from the 7 or so letters we know of his.   We can generally believe that he met people named Peter, James, and John who were ""reputed to be pillars"" and ""seemed to be important."" We know that he claimed his knowledge of Jesus came through revelation and scripture and claimed that other apostles had similar sources of knowledge. I think we can trust Paul's claims on these things. Do we need to believe he really had revelations? I don't know. Maybe in his own way he did. I think we need to lean toward Paul believing in the truth of his claims.  I would think the court would think very dimly of the hearsay claim that 500 anonymous people had a revelation of the Risen Christ."
fact_1086	fact	Jesus! Another scientific illiterate. The facts are the observations. And the point is not to test facts but to explain them with an hypothesis that suggests a prediction as a consequence that can be tested by experimentation.
fact_384	fact	Well, that would seem pretty obvious under that definition that it did not arise because of a single court case.
fact_2202	fact	Our definition of omniscient does not include virtual. That tells me that omniscient means having infinite knowledge.

fact_1737	fact	Sounds like a fact which has been blown out of all proportion - possibly by the pro-gun side attempting to ridicule it. It is a fact, however, that the presence of a gun can increase aggression levels in individuals.  See other times I have brought this up, here (to the end of the thread) and here (again, that post till the end of the thread).
fact_1723	fact	The latter does happen, though not often enough to explain evolution. Again, your're bending over backwards to exclude one part of the ToE, but you're using other parts of the ToE to try and do so. And you can certainly 'say' whatever you like; what would help is some evidence.
fact_1045	fact	Give a link to your objection and I'll take a look and get to responding when I have more time.
fact_623	fact	In the past 85 years, dating has drastically improved. You're falsely saying that scientists have readjusted the date because it suits their timeline, rather then noticing that dating has improved and new techniques have been used on virtually every piece we have today. Learn to use Oczzam's razor.
fact_145	fact	So the number of deaths due to hospital screw up is almost 19 times higher than the murder rate involving firearms. Quite disturbing if you ask me. To this this suggests that we should look into more tightly regulated medical degrees than anything else.
fact_151	fact	Heart bypass, prostate cancer.......I have a couple of Canadian friends who needed those surgeries and one was told he had a 4 month wait and the other a 6 month wait so they both came down to Bellingham Wash and had the Surgery within 2 weeks............
fact_637	fact	And I'm saying all but 16 states had already had the law removed before the Loving case. Most of these were done via the legislature and very few had the law overturned by a court. In fact, only California comes to mind as a state that had the statue overturned by the courts instead of on repeal by the legislature.   Who knew...but there is a wikipedia page on this: Anti-miscegenation laws - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia  It doesn't say whether or not it was via a court case or not but I know that California was a court case and Massachusetts and many Northern/mid-west state were via legislature action.  Also, the Supreme Court case ruled the Virginia law unconstitutional not the Alabama law. It is just understood that similar laws will be overturned thus they are negated.
fact_1290	fact	Gary Ridgway, the serial murderer of some 60 or more women, possibly more.
fact_179	fact	Let's take this slowly...  a) Montalban is asked to give a definition of unknowables, and does so  Mach: It's illogical, merely defining it doesn't prove it exists.  b) Mach is asked to show a scientific test for dark  Mach: Look I don't have a scientific test for dark, but I can prove it exists by giving a definition of it!  Once again you defy yourself! So, merely defining 'darkness' does not prove it exists BY SCIENCE. What you have done is to confirm that it can't be defined BY SCIENCE.  SHOW ME THE SCIENCE THAT DEFINES DARKNESS. If you can't then we have evidence for a suggestion that something exists (in nature) that science can't test for.
fact_1284	fact	This is correct. It is almost insulting to regard people as either a) Christian OR Catholic - as this also implies that Orthodox are neither
fact_838	fact	It is the lower receiver with the serial number.      Everything else on the weapon are 'parts'.
fact_1509	fact	Just like in memetic algorithms, there are many paths to an endpoint. Both memetic algorithms in development and in the docking simulation converge on similar endpoints each time it is rerun. (e.g. skin in development).
fact_2000	fact	"So the fact that there are fewer crimes in britain is evidence, but the fact that there is a great deal more crime in S Africa, despite having some of the strictest gun control laws in the world, is not?   In new york, the reduction in crime was the result of an overhaul of police and the criminal justice system. Couple pages on that:  http://www.city-journal.org/html/15_1_ny_crime.html  http://www.ny.gov/governor/patrecord/crime.html  New York started instituting prohibitive firearms laws in the 60s. Most of the firearms laws they ""enjoy"" now were put in place in the 70s (except for a brief round of idiocy in the 90's having to do with semi-auto rifles....""assault weapons"", which they banned despite the fact that the police commissioner of NY City testified that they had no record of one ever being used in a crime).  So, they had prohibitive gun control for 30+ years, and then when they spent billions on theri criminal justice system and police, none of which had anything to do with gun control, their crime rate started to fall, and somehow you want us to believe that this was due to the gun control? Nobody here is that gullible."

fact_804	fact	Its true. emoticon_xbye
fact_1535	fact	Well, actually there is. Bat wings for example are one of the easier problems for evolution to solve (we can even see potential transitional stages in other animals like the flying squirrel). The co-option of existing structures is the bread and butter of evolution. Now, if bats and birds had four legs and wings, that would be more of a head-scratcher.
fact_1253	fact	Under the illogical view of the 14th amendment that currently occupies our court system there is nothing more about it than convincing 5 judges that it isn't immoral. Let's not pretend this is anything related to what the amendment actually says because we both know it isn't.
fact_1247	fact	Kelvin's already proposed that the armed population of America has given serious protection to the US, specifically he mentioned Japan deciding not to invade.  This is of course a nonsense. Iraq is a heavily armed nation -guns were given out to the general population before the USA invaded - ahem- I mean 'liberated'. Did it stop the US?  Secondly, the specific example given; that of Japan, is a nonsense. These same people who flung themselves in flying bombs, who refuesed to leave foxholes when starving - and would resort to cannibalism rather than surrender, he believes were worried about a few grannies carrying sawn-off shot-guns.
fact_810	fact	Your argument, I believe. The one I said doesn't hold water. It appears to claim that the placing of restrictions upon items specifically designed for the killing of other human beings is somehow comparable to and a prelude for the banning of everyday items whose intended use is in no way connected to harm of others. Your title then equates this with a step towards a form of government in which one person is afforded executive, legislative and judiciary power over the country they control.
fact_1521	fact	So, when you talk about the chemical ingredients are you talking about compounds or elements?      If you are talking about compounds Peeling's point is valid.      If you are talking about elements you answer your own question.
fact_2028	fact	How about rationality? It is not the same as intelligence (which is more like 'mental capability' or 'ability to learn' as opposed to specific process of identification (the axiom of consciousness).
fact_2031	fact	Actually its 14 billion years. Hovind is not claiming what science does.
fact_809	fact	So, we agree again. This is the second time you have labeled one of my points meaningless. I do not disagree. In and of themselves, they are meaningless. Any meaning is assigned to them by whoever wishes to interpret them.
fact_1538	fact	But the point you miss is that a caterpillar is NOT a butterfly; a puppy is NOT a full grown dog; a ZYGOTE and a FETUS are NOT children.      These entities have not YET grown or developed or changed into those other entities.
fact_2025	fact	And it was not the 9th Amendment that the court has used to accomplish this. Rather, it is the 14th through various illegitimate legal doctrines such as incorporation and substantive due process.
fact_835	fact	I think the currently popular belief is that time itself is limited. Space, time, energy, matter and laws all came into existence together. Of course that's impossible for us to envisage....
fact_1504	fact	And to deny that there are no transitionals without having the integrity to at least making an effort to learn what you are talking about is ridiculous. There are lots of transitional fossils. Museums are full of them and more are being discovered on an almost daily basis. There are news stories that report them all over the place. Try reading At the Water's Edge: Fish with Fingers, Whales with Legs, and How Life Came Ashore but Then Went Back to Sea by Carl Zimmer. It will tell you about two transitional series. Also read Taking Wing: Archaeopteryx and the Evolution of Bird Flight by Pat Shipman for the story of what we can learn from even limited transitional specimens and why. Also read The Mistaken Extinction: Dinosaur Evolution and the Origin of Birds by Lowell Dingus and Timothy Rowe. I found the book excellent even though recent finds of feathered dinosaurs have made some of the material a bit dated. It will give you an idea of how the fossil record fits together. At least you might learn what a transitional is.
fact_1262	fact	And I think that if I fall off a tall cliff, I'll die. Does that mean that gravity and science are either evil or incorrect?
fact_1276	fact	Because Matthew, society has to take the time to define its standards. We don't start with the assumption that anything-goes; standards are developed over time. Your question is no different than the recent couple in Germany in the news who are brother and sister wondering why they should not be allowed to marry. Marriage laws have to have limits somewhere in terms of what sort of arrangements of people suffice to be considered marriage, and this is all a part of simply determining (over time) where those limits fall.  Many rights in our society DID have to go through a people-deciding process, so you are wrong that on no other issue do we see that sort of thing happening. In fact, even with civil rights itself, it happened in the form of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. It happened earlier than that with women's suffrage. Voting on civil rights is a well established precedent. Some things have become rights, some haven't. It's a process that our society goes through in defining its standards. The problem is that some in your movement seem to want to circumvent that process.
fact_2019	fact	It also allows SCOTUS to strike down State laws that violate constitutional rights ;)
fact_821	fact	Ah ha! Someone who understands the application of information theory to biological organisms. By the biological specific definition of information, the genome of any organism is information about the environment in which it lives.
fact_1510	fact	This does not mean that the column is fantastic nor imaginative. It may very well be that not all areas of the earth accumulated all types of rock that form the column; this does not mean that the years at which similar columns were deposited in different places in the world are not similar. And of course, even if the Geologic column is not true, this provides no evidence of creationism.
fact_612	fact	Finally someone answered the question. Thanks. I thought it might be the government.  Does your government attempt to do this?  What do you think about other democratic nations that have citizens that are less armed? Do you think that they're in danger - or is it only the American government that's out to do this?
fact_174	fact	The argument that the baby is not a parasite, but is rather 'in its natural environment' seems a false dichotomy: it is natural for a parasite to be in the enviroment of another's body, invading it. The relationship element will be dealt with in the third section.
fact_160	fact	Your XXX-umption that is a poor attempt to certify a false delimma has long been answered. How many people have been killed in Africa with short handled hoes and machetes? Nary a gun amoungst them.

fact_606	fact	I'll give you that, though there is a whole school of debate about what thoughts are.
fact_148	fact	I don't see how one can be a agnostic and be a Deist either. Deism requires a origin, some form of a clockmaker. To not be sure that such a being exists is to fail one of the most basic ideas of Deism.

fact_1706	fact	As I understand, Scalia and Thomas are some of the most conservative members of the court.
fact_1712	fact	Please explain to me how radiometric dating is based on the presupposition that there is no God. You're telling me that if there was/is a God the results of radiometric dating change?   Abiogenesis is not scientific theory, and for good reason. Like you said it just has no evidence. That's why it is considered a hypothesis. It is one of many including creation, which was taught in my public high school. I have no problem with this, but the problem becomes when it is taught as a fact or as a valid alternative to evolution. As long as the truth is taught, that there is really no proof for either abiogenesis or creation, I'm fine. But this debate is whether or not Intelligent Design should be taught as a valid alternative to evolution.
fact_1074	fact	"Some in S Africa do not think their gun laws are strict enough. Some in New york city do not think THEIR gun laws are strict enough. This just shows that there are XXXXXX everywhere.  In S Africa, you are required to have a permit to own any firearm. Any criminal activity, or ""questionable"" associations result in the refusal of a permit. Over 60% of permit applications are denied, and penalties for posession of an unlicensed weapon are severe. YET, unlicensed weapons outnumber licensed ones.  The problem with gun control laws is that they seldom contain a crime control element. Somebody who is going to rob a liquor store is not likely to stop and rethink their plan because their firearm is illegal. They are getting ready to commit a felony anyway. Nobody is going to decide NOT to murder somebody because they fear being charged with illegal posession of a firearm.  Gun laws essentially only apply to law abiding citizens. A criminal is, by definition, somebody who does not obey the law. You cannot legislate away criminality."
fact_376	fact	"Well, ""evidence"" for an extraterrestrial creation isn't just through visions and people who have ""seen"" UFO's.  You forget ""evidence"" given by astronomes such as the people from SETI. (SETI is an organization founded after scientists have discovered a strange signal from outer-space. From there on the organization has developed very much)  The signal, the SETI people got showed the first three prime numbers. This is very strange because it has never happened before (the scientist who detected the signal, called it WOW-signal, because it was so strange)  This signal shows a major part of Design: Specification  But unfortunately, to show that it is really true, it is missing another part: Complexity  The signal is evidence, but unfortunately it is too short. If those scientists would detect a signal that shows the prime numbers from 2 to 101 it would meet both parts: it has specification and complexity...  The SETI people would party all night...  So these ""theories"" aren't as unproven as you think they are...  (I still don't believe it happened like that)"
fact_1921	fact	You draw very interesting conclusions my friend.   If this is your standpoint then what is the purpose of a government?
fact_410	fact	Are you incapable of reading, as well as being mind-numbingly assinine? The thread is about creationism, not evolution. Attacking evolution does not defend the lies of creationists. Your failure to defend biblical creation shows that you cannot support your own position and instead have to resort to petty nit-picking of your opponent's position. This is both stupid and intellectually dishonest.
fact_1935	fact	In case you were wondering, no one here has missed the fact that you're trying to divert attention from the real issues by beating one minor issue into the ground.
fact_404	fact	An interesting analysis of that article you keep quoting from the World Net Daily. http://www.saneguns.org/commentary/comment002.html
fact_362	fact	Just to follow suit - note the bolded: What do you mean everyone knows who made everything. If that were true then there would be no religious differences throughout the world, no theological discussion, no theory of evolution, no need for this thread.  As for your assertion that evolution is random/accidental, you are, yet again, making a false statement (either through ignorance or deliberate falsehood). Mutation is random, natural selection done by waiting to see which mutation makes survival (and propagation) more likely. There will also be random events such as natural disasters, ice-ages, droughts etc which do introduce a bit of random luck into the equation, but that's about it.  If this thoughtful being created a harmonious existence, doesn't the extinction of umpteen species screw things up somewhat, or can your inexplicable harmony just carry on regardless.  Smiley

fact_2421	fact	Wead my weply to wascally...  Species evolve because the sequence and organisation of genes evolves. It doesn't take a vast amount of genetic change to evolve one species from another, but it does take genetic change, and molecular geneticists are currently mapping the sort of changes needed to alter rates and timing of gene expression.  If you remove the genes from a cell that requires constant gene expression to function, it will cease to function. That's so obvious it doesn't need explicating. I do not see, hoever, how any of this can be used to make an anti-Darwinian case.  Biologists already know there's more to evolution than Darwinian natural selection, hells bells, even Darwin knew that! There is nothing in theory to prevent autoregulatory gene networks that control their own expression evolving by natural selection. If there is, somehow every biologists seems to have missed it.

fact_56	fact	Certainly he did. I have known many scientists (mostly biologists) who had a similar attitude. The problem is that you have it upside down. The study of glorious, naturalistic science informs us of God's creation. You are trying to impose your childish version of your god on the universe.
fact_2353	fact	Hetero or not is irrelevant.      Society over the millenia has set up the institution of marriage which set up as being between people of opposite genders.      You are of course entitled to persuade people to change the concept.
fact_42	fact	Then you shouldn't have any problem backing up your claims with some invoices, requests and approval and any Constitutional evidence that you are correct. The fact is, as stated by CNN, Fox and other media is that 14 SCHOOL BUSES were used for transportation. I suppose that would make the school liable if anyone was injured also? Seems like you are the one with baseless claims? There isn't anything LIKELY but your desire to support thugs.
fact_1882	fact	And neither can millions of other heterosexuals, something you ignore. As for nature, technically anything that occurs ever without supernatural causes is in fact in nature. We are a part of nature. Everything we do is a part of nature. Therefore, by taking the genetic data of two gays, placing it in a egg and having a surrogate mother bring it to term, gays can reproduce themselves.
fact_1114	fact	Yes. www.talkorgins.org
fact_1672	fact	Really, with C being between 1/2 and 2 million defensive gun uses per year. Or perhaps the hundreds of millions of legal, non-defense related, gun uses per year. When you compare the number times a guns are used legally to the number of times they are used illegally, B becomes pretty insignificant.
fact_1666	fact	So what? The allele frequency, even in your example has still changed. A change in an allele frequency in a population over time is, by definition, evolution. What did you think that evolution was?

fact_202	fact	So sex is only a privelage for those who can phisically give birth? Abortion is not Black and White as you are trying to paint it to be. It's much more complicated. Having a baby, even giving it up, causes a lot of emotional and phisical pain, and most people just cant have babys. They cannot care for it, and they cannot bear to be thinking that their child is out there somewhere. As I have said before, this is much more complicated than you think. Abortion should always be availible in the first and maybe second trimester, so that women wont have to live the rest of their life in fear and abstinence because they cannot support a baby.  This is an interesting article:  http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15173072/site/newsweek/  I would suggest reading it, just to get a better Idea of our position.
fact_2384	fact	Yes they sure will.... with what 776 accidental deaths last year due to guns as opposed to 3,402 accidental drownings seems like more should be spent on preventing drownings than guns. But if your intellect is not up to understanding hyperbole (literary form of exageration to express a point) I will try in the future to keep it down to your level.

fact_1855	fact	"""Iraq, one of the most heavily armed countries in the world, is believed to harbor enough guns to arm every one of its 24 million citizens. Iraqi civilians also have access to other light weapons, such as rocket- propelled grenades, mortars, and bombs - making their arsenals potentially more deadly.  ""In the absence of a governing force in Iraq, some Iraqis are looking to increase their personal weapons caches in order to protect themselves from looters and roving armed gangs; others want small arms to conduct illegal activities and gain political power. Reports have surfaced that gun merchants have set up shop on the streets of Baghdad, selling AK-47s for as little as $10.""  War ends, but Iraq battle over small arms just begins | csmonitor.com  In this thread I was told that handguns were useful in combating tyranny-  http://www.4forums.com/political/gun...-relevant.html  So I'm supposed to believe that handguns are useful in battling tyranny but not having numerous amounts of the above weapons? Shows how inconsistent people can be when it serves their agenda."
fact_1699	fact	Right. Please, reread your argument. Not to mention what Woodward actually said about Piltdown man. www.talkorigins.org
fact_570	fact	Actually, the idea that the death penalty costs more than lifetime imprisonment has been disproved many times. The lowest estimate of the yearly cost for imprisoning somebody is around $22,000. The average amount of time a prisoner spends imprisoned after getting a life sentence is 60 years. Take into account the cost of building jails in order to house all these prisoners and you up the amount even more. After the average of 60 years for a life sentence, tax payers have spent $1,320,000 on ONE SINGLE PERSON. Imagine what this money could do in the education system? You said yourself, the only thing that may push the cost of the death penalty over life imprisonment is the ridiculous amount of appeals that are given. If only one appeal was given before the sentence was final, it would be far cheaper to exectue somebody than imprison them for life. How many times does a person need to prove their innocence? If they can't do it in the initial trial and after one appeal, sorry, game over...you lose. You can read more at this site:  http://www.cwrl.utexas.edu/~tonya/spring/cap/pro5.htm

""Off course, you might be trying to infer that because there are differences of opinion in the field of evolution makes the whole notion irrelevant.

fact_558	fact	A) we can use experiments to show evoution. We have observed it. For example, there is the lactose test, where some bacterial had the gene  to digest lactose removed. After letting it grow into the billions, and  then fed ONLY lactose, it can be shown that some individuals had a gene  that could digest lactose, and survive. There is also anti-bodic resistant  bacteria that evolved due to the use of antibodics .. evolution at work.
fact_1869	fact	Actually, Peeling and others on this thread have proven you and Cash to be utterly wrong. The fact you don't recognize this is irrelevant.

fact_1458	fact	I can. Americans won the Revolutionary War which was primarily a guerilla war. emoticon_xgood
fact_969	fact	There is little confidence in the system as it presently exists. That's why people want a public option included, or to scrap the entire bill for real reform like single payer.   American health insurance, as a system, is not designed to provide assurance of health care, and when we need it most.
fact_2151	fact	The scope of the conference was ONLY the discussion of illicit weapons trade on the international market. It had nothing at all to do with the ownership of weapons by private individuals EXCEPT as it pertained to the illicit sales of arms on the international market.  THATS IT. NOTHING ELSE. They were not debating private ownership of arms, and such debates were discouraged. When a group from handgun control inc. attempted to give a presentation, they were politely told that the the scope of the conference did NOT include privae gun ownership by individuals.   HEre is a link to the UNs goals:  http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/  They run from word hunger to economic reform to higher educational standadrds. There is nothing there about guns.  Here is a link to their news page:  http://www.un.org/News/  You can also get a newsletter from them that is mailed right to your door every day to be read at your leisure.  I don't really have any feelings about the UN one way or the other. They are a large force that helps shape world politics, so I follow what is going on there.
fact_1470	fact	No, it's often an emotional show. They choose their families based on submitted videos, usually from families with one or more physically challenged members, then they build them a house to fit their needs.  There was one in particular with a blind autistic boy who loved to swing. The joy on his face when he got the new swing would make any sensitive person weep with joy for him. There was another about a deaf couple whose new home included and lot of strobe light signaling systems.  BTW, alcohol is a depressant! emoticonXWow

fact_799	fact	"The ""darwinists"" are already aware of all of that and have been for decades."
fact_2179	fact	"Except that that would be the author's words, not a direct quote. Notice the absence of quotation marks? Special Agent Newell never said ""17% came from the US"". The author has as much trouble with the stats as you. 17% of the total have been traced to the US. We don't know the percentage of the total that did indeed come from the US but is untraced or untraceable. See the difference?"
fact_1316	fact	Okay.  The best succinct representation of the scientific method is probably circular:  We make an observation about what we see.  We form a hypothesis based on our observation.  We perform an experiment to test the hypothesis.  We make an observation about what we see (in the experiment).  Rinse and repeat...  Now add a spur: after repeated refinement and confirmation of hypotheses, a theory is devised.
fact_1302	fact	You mean that hole that has been observed and proven, repeatedly? Climate Change is a controversy in the same way as the earth being broadly spherical is a controversy. There's a group of nutters who think the earth is flat; doesn't mean there is any reason to believe it is.

fact_955	fact	Actually Batman did carry and use a gun in the early comics, and he also killed the villains sometimes.
fact_766	fact	"Oh goody. Some more of your well informed opinion based on wishful thinking, no research and even less actual thought. Probably the bird you are talking about is the Cormorant (Nannopterum harrisi). Yes, it is flightless because it has no need to fly. There were no natural preditors in the Galapagos and the bird is a sea bird. It swims and eats fish. It's wings are much reduced because it swims by kicking rather than by ""flying"" through the water like a penguin. Like the penguin it is a diving bird."
fact_2186	fact	Well . . . one could make that argument about anything--voting for instance. Amendments are created by voting, and people and legislatures vote (hopefully) their conscience (and the will of their constituents), even if they are religious. I think this is a different matter than, say, displaying religious icons on courtroom walls or grounds, which is a clear endorsement of religion by the government.   The 18th amendment was religion-motivated, but it didn't get rescinded for THAT reason. It got rescinded because it didn't work practically. (and because FDR wanted to see the returns on the economy for his New Deal)
fact_2192	fact	Again that is a poor analogy. Congress does not have any powers NOT included in the Constitution. Quite the opposite, it specifically says that any powers NOT included in the Constitution is defaulted to the states and Congress is additionally prohibited from taking any more authority NOT named in the Constitution.  Since there is no specific naming article saying Congress does not have the power to ban manufacturing weapons, in fact it DOES NOT. According to the 10th Amendment:  The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people.  Thus you have another poor analogy. Congress DOES NOT have the right to ban manufacture of guns.
fact_772	fact	Well, I'm basing it first and formost on the states which passed ammendments banning same-sex marriage. The percentages in those states were almost completely lower than 80%, with perhaps one or two exceptions. This indicates that even in the least supportive states, 80% is usually too high a number. Unfortunately, I cannot come up with a good website that lists all of the percentages, but you should be able to look around. This was the least important thing I wrote in that entire post, so I'm not too worried about it.
fact_982	fact	"Actually, they are genetic. Our cells have receptors which are triggered by exposure to pathogens; that's how we ""learn"" to fight off a disease. And not everyone has the same receptors, which ones you posses is a genetic trait. It's one of the reasons that Native Americans were so vulnerable to European diseases, they hadn't evolved the receptors that would have enabled them to build up defences against the diseases the Europeans had lived with for generations. If your hypothesis was correct we wouldn't see different populations having different reactions to the same disease."
fact_996	fact	It contradicts a literal interpretation of the Bible.
fact_997	fact	Really? So suppose that you have two models for the way the solar system works. You measure where the planets are today in the night sky, and you use both models to predict where the planets will be ten years from now. In ten years you make actual measurements. The predictions of the first model for Mars are off by, say, a tenth of a minute of arc. The second model is off by a hundredth of a minute of arc. (For comparison, the full moon in the sky has a width of about 30 minutes -- I may be wrong about this). So, are you saying the first model is wrong? The error seems to be pretty tiny (by most standards). What about the second?
fact_983	fact	"In that case it would be not registering your guns which would lead to confiscation rather than registering your guns. The logic of your argument seems questionable. It would be like arguing- ""It's the outright truth that property taxes lead to confiscation because if you don't pay them the government can take your property."" Would anybody seriously think that that is a good argument against property taxes?"
fact_773	fact	"We can't pick both? Why the hell not? Phenotypic plasticity is not an unknown phenomenon or fringe belief. You are presenting a false dichotomy. Plasticity arose via ""Darwinian"" evolution, not instead of it.  To clarify: we do not claim that life evolved via Lamarckian mechanisms, but we don't deny that plasticity is real. What we reject is that that plasticity is the driving force of change."

fact_767	fact	"So it's shifted from ""no new structures"" to ""I can think of a structure that can't evolve."" Me too. Evolutionary theory says that some things are not possible to evolve. But new structures, as you learned, do evolve."
fact_1303	fact	Hm, that does not seem to match the reading of Steven's dissent. He seems pretty set against incorporation.      [T]he right to possess a firearm of one&#8217;s choosingis different in kind from the liberty interests we have recognized under the Due Process
fact_954	fact	"Yes, you do have a problem with Archaeopteryx. You can't explain it from a creationist point of view. I'm not claiming that it is a ""link,"" whatever that may be. It is a transitional form. It is a small theropod dinosaur that has characteristics that are common to theropod dinosaurs and only theropod dinosaurs and their ancestors. It also has characteristics that exist in birds and only birds. Some characteristics exist in both. The furcula, for example. A furcula has been identified in some theropods, but it is rather rare and then only imprefectly preserved. An indication that it may be mostly connective tissue. Archaeopteryx has a furcula. But even at that it doesn't compare to the same structure in birds. It is intermediate. Imagine that!"
fact_1465	fact	I counted the cases listed, not the body counts of each case.
fact_2178	fact	Well, I disagree that it discriminates against unmarried heterosexual couples; those couples still have the choice to get married to recieve the benefits of marriage or stay unmarried. Same-sex couples do not have that choice currently, and all we are talking about is giving them that choice. Unmarried heterosexual couples are not affected and have the same choice available to them.  Though now that I think about it, you may be saying that the common law statutes are applies to unmarried opposite-sex couples but not to unmarried same-sex couples? Well, in all honesty I think that is very unfair regardless of marriage status. The same common law rules should apply to both heterosexual and homosexual couples. I see no reason why this wouldn't be updated along with marriage.  As for common law statutes being used against same-sex partners, well again, that is an argument against marriage or common law statutes, not against same-sex marriage specifically. It isn't a reason to disallow marriage to same-sex couples but allow it for opposite-sex couples.
fact_798	fact	The likely flaw of this argument is defining Communism. Communism as defined by Marx and Engel has never been implemented. Furthermore, Communism as defined by Marx and Engel IS democracy. Often people either forget that or have no idea what Communism is. Historically, Communist supporting ideology candidates that have won democratic elections have been removed by force (or attempted) by Western powers. Chile, Nicaragua, Guatemala, several African nations including Mozambique, the list is actually quite long.
fact_940	fact	There are certainly other theories, but the big bang is the only one supported by the evidence.
fact_1471	fact	"Halton Arp is far from suppressed.  Any complaints about telescope time echo the complaints of astronomers everwhere that have to clamor and compete for the same telescopes.  And I just looked up Gentry because I've never heard of him.  I'd say that if he is ""suppressed"" then its merely due to the fact that he hasn't survived the peer review process. This is true for any number of people who have devised alternate theories to the BB. None of these guys has a beef with godless creation, they just think they have the right answer. There are people into the plasma universe, and the electric universe, or whatever, then there are people like Eugene Savov and his ""fireworks"" universe. These people are generally considered crackpots, but they aren't pushing creationism, they are just pushing theories weaker than the BB theory. But really, the BB theory has problems all over the place, most physicists will admit this.   But Alton Harp hasn't produced enough of these ""weird"" redshift images to have any significant statistical impact. I think he has cataloged a few dozen of these, most of which can be explained away. The ones that can't are just curiosities. Then there isn't a systematic way to look for these things, so any telescope time he applies for would be taken up by random searching, which is probably why someone else gets the telescope time."

fact_559	fact	And like drugs, banning firearms would create another tax free black market, supplied by underground smuggling and manufacturing. Making a pistol with low chamber pressures, especially a semi or full auto firing from an open bolt, is no big deal to a competent machinist. Guns like the MC-10 are made mostly from stamped steel, simple to manufacture in a spare room. This all sounds like legislation of morality, proven to be impossible.
fact_80	fact	"Your obvious ignorance of medical procedure is astonishing. I do not think any such uninformed person has a right to an opinion, but since you have decided you do, let me try to inform you. A doctor would never ""stick a pair of scissors"" into a baby's head. Any propaganda that has told you otherwise is just that, propaganda. If the doctor is ""holding in his hands"" a baby about to be born, (which implies labor) and that child weighs more than 500 grams (just under two pounds), he is required by law to do all in his power to protect and support that child's life. Partial-birth abortion is done only in a case when the mother's life is at stake, no, it does not always ""save the mother's life"" in some cases it is done as a prophylaxis against an event in which life-saving measures would be deemed neccessary. Example- the mother has advanced liver disease, when she concieved it seemed as though it would be possible to carry the child, but as her pregnancy advanced, so did her disease, so that now she is in complete renal failure. The doctors advise her that if she continues with her pregnancy, she is putting her own life and that of ther child into jeopardy. He urges her to abort the child, in order to save her life. This is one case where a partial-birth abortion would be the method.  If the woman decides to continue her pregnancy, she might die, the child might die as well. But if she chooses not to have the child, she lives to fight another day.   Tough choices- What right on earth would I have to enter into this situation and tell her that ""god says you gotta put your life at risk and carry this child, even though both of you might die""????  I may be sick, but I pride myself on the ability to create an informed opinion on a matter, and until I am informed, I keep my opinions to myself.  That should be in the bible somewhere"
fact_2391	fact	"Without a doubt Peter is my favorite in the NT.  Acts 2 is a shocking turn of events, when on the day of Pentecost 3,000 believed in Jesus as the Jewish Messiah, and were saved and received the power of the Holy Spirit.  Truly God used the lowest and most worthless and in Peter's lowest, God used the occassion for the highest Good. And, at the end of his life, he asked to be cruicified upside down (a merciful request, BTW) - who could make this scenario up?  Why would 3,000 Jews believe in a dead Messiah? Why was the tomb empty? If Jesus was not the Messiah, who could believe the Gospel?  Why would anyone risk being a Jewish heretic, and being cast out of Jerusalem? Acts 7 if memory serves me, or 8,9 as the believers in ""The Way"" - Jews for Jesus as it were, were expelled from Jerusalem.  Some did stay behind with James, who was later beheaded 40 - 50 A.D. or so. More for tomorrow.......L8r, Rich"
fact_1840	fact	Well the premise you claim is not the core premise of evolution. Indeed Darwin never invoked genes at all. He did make the observation that some variability was clearly inherited (but not all variability), he also observed that some variants survived and reproduced better than others. From this he concluded that natural selection operated to change the heritable traits exhibited by populations, and extended this to resulting in large changes over long times. Changes sufficient to result in new species which were reproductively isolated or nearly so. To an actual Darwinist genes did not enter the theory at all - they were not known at the time except to an obscure Monk who published in a less than prominent journal!  As to a fish morphing into a human without any genetic alterations .... Produce a case where that has happened and we can discuss it in depth. Till then I will claim that such a transformation cannot be accomplished without alteration of the underlying genome. I am most dubious that you have any such example at hand. emoticonXGood
fact_571	fact	"So... the cells have two equivalents of the digestive system and two of the respiratory system(s)?  I know that the cell's reproductive system is unlike human reproduction, in that one cell duplicates itself and a person does not.  I would also like to know what either of you consider to be the cell's ""circulatory system."""
fact_1698	fact	Because? The conventional big bang is just as unlikely as God. Therefore your claim is wrong.   However the current believe mainly among physicists and astronomers is that there is no end and there is no beginning to the universe. Expansionary theories along with contractionary theories that are being observed have led many to believe that the current universe was born from the death of the last universe. There is no end and there is no beginning.  You are out of your league.

Spetner argued that this is not an example of an increase in information until he had it repeatedly and undeniably shown to meet Spetner's own definition of information. Only now has he said, ""Okay, so it's an increase, therefore it's not random."" Classic moving the goalposts syndrome.  But if wabbit would like to continue leaning on Spetner as a ""reliable source,"" I won't stop him. More fun for me."

fact_94	fact	I think this is why people like Paul Helmke think that Supreme Court rulings on the constitutionality of gun control laws are win/win situations for his side. He realizes that an individual rights interpretation or a ruling that the states are bound by the Second Amendment could still leave the door open for plenty of gun control.
fact_2385	fact	This statement is wrong. People from hundreds of years before Jesus was born prophesied that a baby would be born, in Bethlehem, of a virgin. There were over 50 more prophesies that were made about his life, and the sacrafice he made to pay for the sins of man, and the bigest one of all...He completely fufilled scripture when he rose from the dead. These men were inspired by Jesus, God, how can you argue that he is not the christ? The odds of one man filling all the prophesies is impossible. And these scriptures have been unchanged for the past 2000-2500 approx years! Thats proof for me that Jesus existed and that he is God. PM me if you like.

fact_2408	fact	And you know what? No amount of epigenetic change is going to turn a fruitfly embryo into a human. One of the reasons they are different, and subject to different epigenetic regimes, is because despite genetic homologies (which evolutionary theory predicts), their genomes are significantly different. They have some different genes, in different quantities, and in different arrangements, and that is critical. Epigenetics alone can't take one species and turn it into another, so far as anyone knows. It takes genomic restructuring, and that happens only through genetic mutation.
fact_1115	fact	Eating cooked food is a change in diet, evolutionary speaking its not different from if you stopped eating leaves and started eating fruit. Its still mutations that are resulting in evolution but the selection process for beneficial mutations includes social things as well as purely environmental ones.
fact_1673	fact	Actually, it is quite apparent that you do not. For one glaring example, below you incorrectly state that a dinosaur fossil has been dated by C-14. Another example of you lack of understanding of the topic is your failure to understand why very old fossils are found on the surface and the principles of dating from geologic strata.
fact_1883	fact	"Actually, the Miller-Urey experiment is basically so simple that with only a little training in the lab you could do it yourself. Please show that you are not a dupe and specify what you mean by ""organic matter"". The experiment was intended to show that in a reducing atmosphere with a source of energy, amino acids can form spontaneously. Several similar experiments have been done since that have shown that the formation of amino acids is almost certain. For example, they have been found in meteors.  But that was a long time ago. More recent work has demonstrated the spontaneous formation of lipid membranes, reproducing molecules. The information is available to anyone who takes the time to educate himself."

fact_1129	fact	And I'm addressing your counter-arguments in that regard. One of those counter arguments has been that both chimps and ourselves had four billion years to evolve to our level of intelligence and that during all that time we were subject to the same ecological pressures. Neither of those statements is accurate. The first is misleading for the reasons outlined above, and the second is simply false: humans have experienced greatly different ecological challenges since we diverged from chimps.

If it isn't a bird then why does it have feathers, opposable hallux, pneumatic bones, a furcula, and even a small carina in one specimen?

fact_1908	fact	"Well Ladywolf, that is really more of an argument than it is an honest question. If marriage was truly a private affair that impacted nobody outside the couple themselves, then, yes, that question would be valid. But that is a very shallow understanding and a very uninformed understanding of the nature of marriage, because marriage is just as much â if not more so â about the community as it is about the couple themselves.   But it's not the community that gets married.  No, it's not the community that gets married, but it's the community that enforces marriage and develops marriage. We need to understand that marriage is just as much a social norm â a social ideal â of the kind of behavior that we expect and need for a healthy vibrant society; as much as it is about the emotional commitment of two people.  One of the biggest issues is the social role of marriage. Marriage domesticates men. Men who are not attached permanently to a woman are men that will practice and engage in socially unhealthy behaviors at a much higher level.   How will same-sex marriage effect the concept of ""marriage""? Marriage becomes reduced down to nothing, because the moral argument for same-sex marriage is the same moral argument for group marriage, for polygamy, and it is going to be impossible to deny polygamous groups â and group marriage people â who come forth in all sincerity and say, ""If you can't restrict marriage to only couples of opposite sex, then you can't restrict marriage to only two people."" They are all very much interwoven.  The three things that you lose are: 1) the domesticating influence of marriage on men; 2) the protective influence of marriage upon women from being victimized and objectified by men; and 3) it provides mothers and fathers for children.   When monogamy is lost as an ideal, the idea that a man should commit himself and forego all other sexual relationships but (the one with) his wife, then women become commodities to be used and collected by men. When committing yourself to a woman and subjugating your sexual desires for the sake of that woman â when that becomes just one lifestyle choice among many, it is devastating to a culture.  Same-sex ""marriage"" also denies every child it touches access to either a mother or father. It is never compassionate to intentionally deny a child either a mother or father."
fact_405	fact	"A minor point, but your opening question is confined to ""during pregnancy"" and your concluding scenario is confined to childcare. The baby has no need of breast milk or a substitute formula until it is a breathing human.

I do not understand the interest in things before the 14th Amendment.  *************************  The 14th Amendment:  Section 1. All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.   Section 2. Representatives shall be apportioned among the several States according to their respective numbers, counting the whole number of persons in each State, excluding Indians not taxed. But when the right to vote at any election for the choice of electors for President and Vice President of the United States, Representatives in Congress, the Executive and Judicial officers of a State, or the members of the Legislature thereof, is denied to any of the male inhabitants of such State, being twenty-one years of age,(See Note 15) and citizens of the United States, or in any way abridged, except for participation in rebellion, or other crime, the basis of representation therein shall be reduced in the proportion which the number of such male citizens shall bear to the whole number of male citizens twenty-one years of age in such State.   Section 3. No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any State, who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.

fact_1934	fact	While this is true, the number of abortions at or after 21 weeks is not insignificant. According to the Guttemacher Institute, 1.2% of abortions occur at or after 21 weeks.

fact_411	fact	"There are two major theories, many hold to the ""Out of Africa"" replacement model.  The perspective of the Out of Africa model (often called Out of Africa II, referring to a second migration from Africa of a hominid population) adherents is that when there was a migration of H. erectus out of Africa into Asia and Europe, these populations (seen in materials like the Chinese and Indonesian erectus) did not contribute a significant amount of genetic material to later populations that led to modern humans (some claim no genetic ancestry to these groups and their descendants at all, a ""strict"" replacement model). At approximately 200 kya there was a second migration of hominids out of Africa. This time it was fully modern H. sapiens, which proceeded to replace whatever populations that then occupied Asia and Europe. Some see direct competition and extermination of the native populations, some see passive replacement due to better adaptive strategies, and some see genetic admixture with the preponderance of genetic material coming from the incoming human populations, eventually replacing and assimilating them into the greater collective. In this view there is a specific speciation event that occurred which led to the origin of H. sapiens in Africa, and this population is the forerunner of modern humans, leaving the European Neanderthals, Chinese erectus, and others out in the cold.  Homo Sapiens"

fact_1713	fact	"There is the ever popular ""smartest state"" report that places kansas at #15 in the nation. It can be found at http://www.morganquitno.com/edrank.htm  A lot of kansas educators take exception to that report because it factors in things that may not be related. For example, Kansas kids score in the top 5 states in ALL testing categories, BUT, we score 38th in spending per pupil. We score poorly in teacher salaries (28), and do not have teachers on our school boards (conflict of interest). All those factors count against us, as well as several others. Then you have new jersey and vermont, where the kids apparently can't take a test, and where their average SAT scores may be confused with a shoe size, and they score in the top 5 because they spend a LOT more than kansas. A lot of people argue that they penalize states for efficiency in their education system.   If you want the most comprehensive report out there, go to www.alec.org and request a copy of their ""report card for education"". I think it is free, and it breaks down the states by several categories. It is what I always used to figure out how good a job our system was doing."
fact_1075	fact	**  Science is more than a methodology. Empiricism and validation by prediction from anticipated regularit is its methodology. If science were nothing more than a methodology, than no science would exist beyond the confines of any particular experiment and/or collection of observations/measurements undergone currently.  However, you are right, in so far as 'science' _should not_ be conflated with and confused for any particular philosophy, with the possible exception of empiticism. But 'should' is not the issue. The fact is that, falsely and irrationally, you and other materialist have tried, and with great success unfortunately, to convince the public that your materialism and 'science' are one and the same. Just denying that you have done so, and that you [and your fellow darwinists] continue to do so in your every post, doesn't cut the mustard.
fact_1061	fact	"So you're saying that the modern day militia no longer utilizes privately owned weapons? In 1792 the militia made use of privately owned weapons and thus the federal government kept a record of privately owned weapons to determine its military readiness.   ""These categories included privately owned small arms and accountrements to be reported to the federal government. These were, in most cases, individually owned private property....There was no outrage or even concern expressed then that an inventory of privately owned weaponry and accoutrements reported to the federal government would somehow 'infringe' on the right of the people,""  http://www.potomac-inc.org/milret.html  ""The Militia Act was about military organization....The Militia Act of 1792 required the states to 'enroll'â that is, registeredâ gun owners for militia duty just as they had been registered for the King's militia. (See .../196gnd.html and Kates in .../196lrev.html). Registration of ownership and the reporting of private sales would shut down the illegal traffic in firearms and empower local jurisdictions to enforce their local rules and regulations. Registration also creates the mechanism to establish legal categories of gun ownership that could effectively disarm the lawless and the disloyal starting with the NRA's 'armed citizen guerrillas.'

In fact, we do not know the exact grounds on which he was declared a heretic because his file is missing from the records.  All the same, he was burned for being a heretic.
fact_2232	fact	Well some of ROCC's comments were addressing issues that lead to unplanned pregnancy. Sexual promiscuity does lead to pregnancy, an increased rate of sex will increase the rate of pregnancies, even when birth control is a factor. I do recognize that there are other problems involved with unplanned pregnancies and issues should be dealt with, though apparently the responsibility of creating solutions to these issues is given primarily to pro-life supporters. There are two main issues that have to be dealt with; reducing the amount of un-planned pregnancies, and giving more options to people who have an un-planned pregnancy. Now this may differ country to country depending on the social services that are available to support an unplanned pregnancy. Desperate action cannot justify making morally objective issues legal, and i say morally objective since I'm sure any sane person will agree that taking away the life of an innocent person is morally objective. Governments could make a lot of money on taxing narcotics to people who wish to take use in them, though this does not justify legalizing narcotics. Desperate drug addicts will be lead to desperate situations of theft in which they even may morally object to, but must partake in in order to feed their drug addiction. Even in the case of underground back-alley abortion clinics, they were just as safe as abortions are today, and haven't been any more dangerous since the invention of antibiotics and anesthetics. These procedures, though underground, were performed by qualified physicians who either believed that women should have the choice to kill their unborn child, or just realize that there was a small demand to do so. (The actual statistic on the demand that were presented in Roe vs. Wade were fabricated by the pro-choice community ten times the actual value)  If you require me to prove or source any of this information, I would be glad to provide it.
fact_149	fact	Entirely wrong on this point. I was in sierra leone during hte rebellion, nad they did have a working government structure from begining to end. Civilians in rebel controlled portions of sierra leone were hacked apart with machetes (literally) and horribly treated because they had no way to fight back. In several circumstances, entire villages were bypassed by the rebels becasue one or 2 people had ignored the ban on guns. Rebels showed up, took fire from the town, and went and found an easier town to pick on. There was a move by certain british folks who worked for certain british companies to arm the civilian population. Unfortunatly, the UN impoased an arms embargo against sierra leone and short circuited the plan.
fact_1288	fact	"It is also a desperate tactic because there are no other intelligent arguments. It is really a ""non-tactic"", and merely just a re-statement of their position: ""I am opposed to changing the definition of marriage to include same-sex couples in the marriage laws because that would change the definition.""  It is semantically indistinguishable from saying, ""I don't like the idea of same-sex marriage.""

fact_2024	fact	Well, the easy answer is that a lizard didn't evolve an avian lung. There is no known example of a lizard that has an avian lung. However, there is a variety of lung morphologies found in reptiles, including simple sacs in some lizards to the partitioned chambers with intricate support structures in organisms such as monitor lizards and crocodilians. And I am sure that peddler is aware that the crocodilians are the closest living relatives of birds, having arisen from an ancestral archosaur. The dinosaurs, through the ornithodirans, also arose from archosaurs. So the more advanced lung structure may have been ancestral since lizards arose from ancestral diapsids which also gave rise to the archosaurs.  So some birds have a system of (usually) 9 flexible air sacs that that act as bellows to move air through the lungs. Although the air sacs are not directly involved in respiration, they do have other functions, such as thermoregulation and weight reduction. Extensions of these air sacs have invaded the skeleton and form what are called pneumatic bones in birds.  However, there is considerable evidence that this condition occurred in organisms ancestral to birds first. Thus, in the maniraptoriformes it may have been useful in weight reduction in running predators and was retained in birds because the weight reduction was also useful for flight.  But some birds, current and fossil, do not have pneumatic bones. For example, Hesperonis lacked them for obvious reasons. But of course, Hesperonis lacked wings useful for flight.  Looks like peddler is just a parrot of what his controlers have told him to say. To bad he lacks the integrity to educate himself.
fact_1539	fact	Of course not, but I fail to see how atheists are using science as its god, can you please explain that to me directly? Evolution doesn't refute god at all. In fact with evolution, intelligent design is entirely possible. But that still doesn't make it science.

fact_2026	fact	"There is not one theory, but a great many to choose from.  If you're talking about the origins of life, many evolutionists believe in abiogenesis - that life somehow just came about out of non-life.  Some will say that evolution and abiogenesis are two distinct theories, but there's a lot of cross-over; begun with Charles Darwin himself who postulated a primordial soup.  Miller-Urey did experiments to try to concoct how life began in a primordial soup of their own design. They failed in essence to demonstrate how life could emerge from non-life through natural means. (Many work on the philosophy that life came about and evolved through naturalistic, or materialistic processes)  It leads people such as Nobel-winner Francis Crick to come up with certain strange notions; Panspermia, of which, his version just shifts the problem, rather than answers it. (see below under PANSPERMIA)  Intelligent Design theorists suggest that some intelligence; possibly, but not exclusively a deity is behind nature; that nature seems to have an order. Some here too casually dismiss ID from science but the door's already open to science  SETI looks for ID  Cryptographers do to  Forensic scientists do  THEORIES OF LIFE...  PANSPERMIA  Panspermia is the idea that life came from outer space. As with all theories this too is not homogenous. There's a general panspermia theory, and a 'directed' panspermia theory. The former is a belief that life came here by random chance, such as on a meteor. The later is that life came here at the behest of an intelligence - such as aliens directing ships to earth laden with the molecules of life.  One idea is that the building blocks of life â...Bakes said nitrogenated aromatics exist throughout the Milky Way galaxy.â http://www.spacedaily.com/news/life-04zw.html  ""Francis Crick also thinks that life on earth may have begun when aliens from another planet sent a rocket ship containing spores to seed the earth. This is no idle thought; Crick first proposed it with chemist Leslie Orgel in 1973 in an article entitled ""Directed Panspermia"" in a professional science journal called Icarus. A decade later Crick wrote a book, Life Itself, reiterating the theory; in a 1992 interview in Scientific American on the eve of the publication of his latest book, Crick reaffirmed that he things the theory is reasonable."" (Behe, M, ""Darwin's Black Box"", p238) which as I said, simply moves the problem to 'where did the aliens come from?'  ""COMPLEXITY THEORY   Stuart Kauffman, a theoretical biologist at the Sante Fe Institute, has put forth the idea that when the necessary elements of the cell formed in the primordial soup (nucleotides, lipids, and amino acids), they were instantaneously integrated into a system, a system which we know as the cell (Cohen, 1996). Kauffman says this was not due to a miracle or chance, but was bound to occur. He rejects other scientists' need to find some sort of genetic carrier like RNA or DNA, or even an aperiodic solid, saying that the life forms may have had no need for them. (An aperiodic solid is one in which the atoms are arranged in some non-repeatable geometric pattern, such as a helix, that would allow for the variation within the structure that is necessary for genetic material). He believes that such genetic carriers could have evolved after the new life was already flourishing. Kauffman has even designed a computer model that shows that when a few organic molecules have developed some catalytic skills and reach the necessary level of diversity, then they spontaneously form an ""autocatalytic set"" (a life form). His theory is based on the general complexity theory, which states that when a system reaches some critical level of complexity, it will naturally produce a degree of complex order (4).""  http://www.lifesci.utexas.edu/cours...2/JENNIFER.html  A. G. Cairns-Smith's Callisto Theory: That life began from a type of living-clay  Richard Dawkins says of this ""Cairns-Smith believes that the original life on this planet was based on self-replicating inorganic crystals such as silicates. If this is true, organic replicators, and eventually DNA, must later have taken over or usurped the role.""  http://originoflife.net/cairns_smith/  ""Other Theories  In spite of the intense level of work on the RNA world in the last decade, there is no true consensus theory for precellular life. There are many theories. Here are some of the others ?  A few scientists still say that DNA could succeed in starting life on its way (11). But even the shortest DNA strand needs proteins to help it replicate. This is the chicken-and-egg problem.   There is a ""proteins first"" school. For example, Manfred Eigen of Germany's Max Planck Institute says, ""There is no doubt that proteins, which are more easily formed, were first on the scene"" (11.5). Of course, these first proteins must be much shorter than any used in life today, because of the sheer unlikelihood of forming useful long ones out of a soup of amino acids.   Physicist Freeman Dyson proposes to solve the chicken-and-egg problem with a double origin, one for metabolism (proteins) and one for replication (strands of nucleotides) (12).   In Seven Clues to the Origin of Life (13), A. G. Cairns-Smith says that clay crystals could have served as the scaffolding upon which the first short DNA or RNA genome was constructed. A new elaboration of this idea prompted one writer to wonder, ""Primordial soup or crÃªpes?"" (14). Even more recently, another tangent on this path leads to zeolite (14.5).   Biologists Harold J. Morowitz (15), David Deamer (16), and others (17), advocate a theory that could be paraphrased as ""containers first.""   Jeffrey L. Bada of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography holds the minority view that the early Earth was frozen and believes precellular life started in ""cold soup"" under the ice (18, 19).   Chemists Claudia Huber and GÃ¼nter WÃ¤chtershÃ¤user say the soup where life originated was actually quite hot, probably, near undersea volcanic vents, where iron and nickel sulfides might catalyze some of the necessary reactions (19.5-19.7).   Cornell Astronomer Thomas Gold wonders if life might have originated in a hot environment even deeper, in Earth's crust (19.8).   Stuart Kauffman of the Santa Fe Institute, says, ""...whenever a collection of molecules contains enough different kinds of molecules, a metabolism will crystallize from the broth"" (20).   Another idea is the ""PNA world."" Because starting the RNA world is so difficult, there probably needs to be a pre-RNA world.

fact_1249	fact	If one can't attempt to falsify a theory then it is not open to science and therfore useless to science.      It becomes simply an untestable belief.
fact_2032	fact	again, please review the definition of an atheist  humor cannot be observed by apparatus that test the physical realm. it is an abstract and intangible quality. so is beauty, artistic ability and pleasure. yet these things exist and are as real to an atheist as it is to a theist. an atheist does not need a devine revelation to appreciate intangible qualities or account for their existence. they can be detected through mental processing, and communicated so that others can agree on the quality and identify it when it is present.  being an atheist does not preclude belief in the existence of intangible and abstract things. it just precludes the belief in god and a spiritual/supernatural realm
fact_822	fact	Soooo lets see. You are denying a slippery slope exists. OK we have all of the gun laws you guys got during the Clinton Administration.   1.The assault weapons ban.   2.The ten round magazine,  3.institution of the waiting period,   4.Brady background checks for all handgun buyers,   5.Excessive fees and regulations that drove many legitimate gun shop owners out of business.  6.Making it illegal for anyone under 18 to own or even possess a handgun.   7.The President's executive order stopping the importation of many guns,   8. Additional disqualification's and changes to legal firearms purchases on form 4473,   9. Insta Check!   10. The widening of Brady to include background checks from just handguns to include all new firearm purchases.   11 Lautenburg.  and just recently the NICS improvement act!  But Yet, you want to add even more gun laws. But the Slippery Slope does not exist? Is that what you are saying?   We have on this board alone, demands on our Constitution's Bill of Rights of total Gun Registration, Mandatory Storage with as of yet undefined penalties, a photo ID. Some advocate banning Assault Weapons, and you yourself have put forth several arguments that the 2nd amendment is not an Individual Right, and it applies only to a states right to form a militia.   But the slippery slope does not exist!
fact_1513	fact	"yes, on the grounds of ""mostly likely"" we can make reasonable assumptions. but we must still treat them as such.  part of the catch of God's existence is that no evidence of his existence cn ever be found. if Jesus actually physically performed observable miracles, even 2000 years ago, then it would surely proven that the supernatural can and does (or did) exist in reality. however, even jesus's ministry contradicts the faith theory. how can God expect faith from those who haven't observed on the grounds of those who have? if people can observe the manifested power of God in reality, then they have physical evidence that God exists. but this conflicts with the nature of God from a biblical standpoint. in other words, the bible cannot claim that physical evidence for the existence of God can exist, and then that it cannot exist, without contradicting itself. what we end up with is the predicament that ANY physical evidence that could possibly support God's existence is evidence against God's existence (at least from a biblical standpoint)"
fact_1275	fact	But the latter is exactly what some (especially in the U.S.) propose as science and truth.

fact_1507	fact	"No.  Sarah Brady wants increased budgets for law enforcement and gun control on the same bill. Which is a slimly trick typical of dirty politicians and lawyers.  That is the ammo use used to claim the NRA is against increased law enforcement budget.  The NRA stands for increased budget only on one bill before Congress.  Sarah Brady notions are irrational because she wants more that what is stated above.  Please check ""no central database"" vs a database.  Please check Sarah Brady's 3 day waiting period + background check.  I agree that rational laws are already on the books. I was merely re-enumerating them.  How does Sarah Brady propose to reduce guns from the street? Only two ways possible: 1) Gun buy back 2) Consfication.  Please check the other threads regarding the astronomical cost of a gun buy back. Please check the Consitution for right of property ownership."
fact_605	fact	No mark, no bullet hole nothing. Her and her father claim that I just touched my gun...which I didn't! They even testified at the preliminary that I didn't touch anyone nor did I make any threat what so ever. That I just put my hand on my gun. The police on the scene didn't charge me. They went to the Sheriffs Dept and took warrants on me and my mother. My wife got my mom for assault claiming she was trying to grab our daughter from her and was fighting with her. Yet again no marks.I even have evidence of premeditated revenge from threatening text messages days earlier from her dad and her saying stuff on myspace. She took out orders of protection on us but the judge dismissed them QUICK! We got indicted so now we're facing a plea hearing. The other judge made us take joint custody. Primary custody has yet been asigned. My lawyer is the best in the area and also a good friend of mine. He's trying to get it dropped before court. But they claim I just touched my Glock. That doesn't meet the statute really in these circumstances. The responding officers even thought it was BS.
fact_163	fact	I'm not aware that the police used violence in arresting any of the people discussed in this case. Besides, I'm not discussing personal morality here, I'm discussing what should be legal, and what is practical in a society where not everyone shares the same moral views. Government is there to apply limits to what is permitted, based on the will of the people.
fact_177	fact	But felons can't vote and I don't see that in the Constitution, either.   I don't have a problem with preventing criminals from legally owning firearms. That said, I think it's against our rights to be assumed to be a criminal without ever being convicted of a crime.
fact_611	fact	Yes, but we do not know that homosexuality is not inherited, and it is the arguments like this that make people want to prove that homosexuality is genetic. Also, people born infertile cannot reproduce, so are those people inferior in a relationship because of what they cannot do?

fact_2224	fact	Again, you are off the mark. This is not a reference to Lamarckism (which is what I guess you were trying to say). Even Darwin observed that novel characters were passed on to offspring. And he was smart enough to realize that these were not characteristics gained from use.
fact_1739	fact	It's like the theory of the moon. We don't know how the moon was created. Captured asteroid, knocked off in a big collision, formed from dust at the same time earth did? We're not sure. But the fact that we aren't sure of the details of how the moon was created in no way casts any doubt on the existence of the moon.  We know evolution is a fact, that's certain. Some of the details we're still learning. Which forms of selection are the most important in what situation, enviromental factors influencing gene expression, the importance of cues picked up pre-nataly. These are all open questions. The fact that we have these questions in no way casts any doubts on the veracity of evolution, it just means that there's still more to learn. That's something that SS doesn't get. If answers don't come 100% complete and tied up with a pretty bow he wants nothing to do with them.

fact_1077	fact	Indeed. Cobb County Georgia. And the sticker was found unconstitutional in Federal Court. The problem was that it was religiously motivated, was placed only in biology texts, didn't say anything true that the teachers weren't already teaching, and actually was not accurate. The sticker was found to be unconstitutional because it violated the second prong of the Lemon Test. I suspect that you don't know what that is. Anyway, the 11th Circuit reversed.

I have not heard of a US court case where a woman sued a hospital for bringing her back to life 'against her will'. Though in America, anything is possible  The oath of a doctor is to save a life. A woman who OD'ed would need to be saved.

fact_361	fact	"**  Like chemist and all other darwinists, you imply wherever possible. But in this case I broke my own best rule and replied to chemist, and was not speaking of you at all.  And you are right, the phenomenon of revertant mutation in eusocial bacteria colonies, [inexplicable in darwinist mechanical terms], as discovered by Cairns, et al, in 1988, is a separate phenomenon from stress-stimulated somatic hyper-mutation. I misled you in the the quote you used to bring in the Cairns work--  "" Under these circumstances [stress-induced hyper-mutation], as per EAM,[above], it has been repeatedly demonstrated [since 1988, at Corning, by that scientist whose name escapes me] that the number of adaptive mutations outnumbers the number of of ineffectual or maladaptive mutations by a strongly significant statistical percentage.""  That was not Cairns, but Barry G. Hall to whom I was referring, and he was a research prof at U. Rochester in the 90's who did work on adaptive mutation, wrt adaptive cellular responses in stressed eusocial bacteria colonies. That is, somatic hypermutation as a cellular,[in multi-cellular organisms, such as eubacteria colonies], adaptive, systemic and systematic [non-randon, non-stochastic, non-accidental] heuristic evolutionary mechanism.  He found that adaptive genetic mutations arising systematically under these circumstances outnumbered maladaptive and inconsequential mutations to a high degree, statistically speaking. A most significant finding, and one that has been repeated again and again and again, to the point where somatic hypermutation is accepted by bacteriologists as a legitimate 'immune response' enabling rapid adaptive [EAM] evolution [antibiotic resistance] in eusocial bacteria."
fact_1936	fact	Just like mathematicians refuse to accept that .5+.5 = 1 and is not just two halves...
fact_407	fact	And I ask the question again. Have you read Dawkins? Do you actually know what he says? It's a bit disengenuous to make such statements if you haven't read the books in question. How shall I say this? You have been duped. Well - that's going to be censored!
fact_1922	fact	Actually gun crime in the UK is at a very low level. If you believe government statistics then gun crime is at its lowest level for years. Police travel in twos because it's easier to catch people when there's more than one of you. It's been standard practise for years in lots of countries. The armour is mostly stab-proof and is largely to counter the rise in gang-related knife crime. It is legal to own weapons in this country, they are just tightly controlled, and as a result we have far less gun crime (particularly where it's not related to organised crime).
fact_413	fact	Actually you could look at this issue in several different ways.Lets start with welfare.Lets say the mother of a newborn who is responsible to finacially and physically take care of her child gets on state aid and agrees to not take child support from the father if he chooses to *opt out*Okay thats fine and dandy but if you think the goverment is going to support HIS child bucause he chooses not to ,well HAHAHA YOU HAD BETTER THINK AGAIN! Anyways things will NOT be equal until a man can actually carry and give birth to a child.Comparring the right to choose abortion and the right to choose not to pay support are completely two different issue that are not comparable.A women has to risk her possible life long health to either choose pregnancy/birth OR abortion a man does NOT risk either in his choice to support or not.This issue doesn't even touch on abortion for rape/incest or health reasons of the mother and or fetus.emoticonXDonno seems to me a deadbeat dad is using the pro-choice position to get out of paying support when HIS body isn't even in the issue.
fact_375	fact	Yes, it does. Read it all. Also go to this link where an Israeli citizen talks about guns and gun-control in Israel.    http://www.counsel.net/chatboards/2nd-amendment/topic38/10.31.02.02.36.24.html      Sounds like Israel has strict gun-control laws but als
fact_349	fact	You know, that is one aspect of the story that no one ever seems to focus on when refuting the flood. I think it is an excellent extra point of refutation of the whole ridiculous story.
fact_2350	fact	Save 95% of fetuses? Pro-lifers have a weird obsession with non-sentient fetal tissue. emoticon_xdonno
fact_41	fact	"What do you mean ""my ultimate agenda""? I want regulation of the gun trade as there is regulation of the trade of every product with specific control laws that apply to each product. Does this mean a complete ban? No. Let's compare this to a drivers license. Yes I realize that's not a product, but it is regulated similar to the way guns should be regulated. It varies from state to state, but there is typically a driver's ed class, driving with an instructor, and a driving test. A person must pass all of these things before recieving a license. A person must also meet other qualifications such as vision requirements. Then, in my state, when a person recieves his or her license, it is only a provisional license, meaning that he or she cannot drive between midnight and 5 a.m. This lasts for eighteen months unless there are any moving violations, in which case the period starts over. These are all reasonable restrictions. These ideas can be applied to gun control. There could be gun training and gun tests. Background information such as prior criminal activities should be checked. Guns should not be made available at unregulated events such as gun shows. These sort of regulations are also similar to those on prescription drugs. A person must have a prescription from a real doctor, and he or she can only purchase or pick up the medicine from certified locations.  This is clearly not a fringe view since a large number of people support gun control. You may disagree with this view, but it clearly is not a fringe view. Nor is it a sign of mental instability.  The constitutionality of gun control is clearly debatable. It's not exactly simple. You can't ignore ""well regulate."" Even GunCite, a pro gun website, says, "" 'To put in good order' is the correct interpretation of well regulated, signifying a well disciplined, trained, and functioning militia."" Disciplining, training. That sounds like controlling. And if it was such a simple constitutional issue, why hasn't the Supreme Court made a difinitive ruling on it? If anything, it has ruled in favor of gun control, saying in the Miller case that ""The Second Amendment must be interpreted and applied with a view to its purpose of rendering effective the Militia."" Regardless, the constitutionality of a law does not make it wrong or right. Slavery was once allowed under the Constitution, but that did not make it wrong or right."
fact_1881	fact	And the good news is that this good trend has continued. According to the latest FBI UCR.   Crime in the United States -- by Volume and Rate per 100,000 Inhabitants, 1989&#8211;2008

No, people arn't looking for healthy, white infants, they are looking for infants. This automatically reduces 90% of adoption cases. The so called ""Healthy white infants"" make up 70% of all adoption cases, seeing that 30% of abortion are done by blacks, and latinos and most minorities don't have abortions, but instead keep their children."
fact_1895	fact	Just to provide some evidence of how incredibly shallow your liberal justifications and imaginings are, here's some light reading for you simone. It's from something called a book. emoticon_xdonno   CHAPTER 9      HEALTH      MORE SPECIFICALLY, MENTAL HEALTH
fact_2344	fact	Yes, although that line changes over time.
fact_55	fact	"You seem to think that any time someone is killed, the reasoning behind it was that the perpetrator ""devalued human life"". If that was the case, gun manufacturers, car manufacturers, breweries, and cigarette manufacturers would ""devalue human life"" simply because they make these products knowing that people will die from their use/abuse. And the government would ""devalue human life"" by letting these companies operate under it. We do not go targeting innocent civilians. More often than not, the civilians are killed by Iraqi suicide bombers or ""militia"", and the few that are killed by the US are accidents."
fact_2422	fact	"It's not an ""arrogant assumption"" to point out that religious faith involves  making a ""leap in the dark"" - it's a metaphor that attempts to illustrate  the facts of the case.  I'm saying that given ADEQUATE EVIDENCE, science, IN PRINCIPLE, can  answer all questions concerning the MATERIAL world. That is actually  quite a limited statement if you bother to read it carefully.  Pointing out some of the achievements of science which could not have  been accomplished in any other way, is not ""raising science on a pedestal""  - it's merely reciting the obvious.  Yes, I am saying that reasoned arguments from anthropology can and do  account for the evolution of morals, the law, etc. in human societies. The  growth in complexity of physical organisms is analogous to the growth of  social complexity in human societies: the study of the former can throw  light on the development of the latter.  I have not tried to address the torrent of ""points"" that cascade into  the of rest of your post: I don't understand what you're talking about.  As for the allegation that I'm driven by ""ideology"" - I haven't a clue what  sectarian policies you think control me."
fact_1103	fact	"So much for lists of registration and ""safe storage"". Same thing happened when Hitler took over a country and got hold of all the lists. They were especially interested in the gun lists and radio lists."
fact_1665	fact	Just have to say something on this. If the boy scouts didnt receive federal support and get special deals from the government then they would be able to exclude whoever they want. However since they often hold their meetings in public schools for free and rent public lands for discounted price or even sometimes for free they cannot discriminate against gays and atheists. So they have to make a choice.
fact_2378	fact	"Actually, if you had paid attention, you would know that every example of IR given by Behe has been debunked. Immune system? Sorry. Debunked. There are examples of organisms with intermediate steps. Blood cloting cascade? Sorry. There are example of animals that accomplish clotting without all of the ""necessary"" factors. Bacerial flagellum? Sorry. Type III secretion systems appears to be a simplified sub-set of the bacterial flagellum's components.  If only you took the time to actually educate yourself rather than trying to pass off mythology as reality."
fact_69	fact	"No. That would be adaption. It wouldn't involve any genetic change. Another word for it might aclimatization. Your example shows little thought. The Polar bear's webbed feet are genetic. Even if a Polar bear lived it's whole live in a cage without ever going near water, it would still have webbed feet.  That really is absolutely the most ignorant thing I have ever heard. The water stretches the skin through friction! Don't you just love ""creation science""? You get to make it up as you go."
fact_598	fact	Actually, might I say that you assume that the criminal had a firearm, correct? This may seem foolish of me, but I'll go along with you. Now, you can assume that a criminal doens't have the right mindset. There's always a first crime, but isn't it illegal for an ex-con, a drug addict/alcholic, or someone who has a few screws loose up there to own a firearm? So we could assume in your situation that the law wasn't enforced. So let's pretend like the law actually is enforced, shall we? What makes you think the criminal has a firearm? If he has a firearm, how do you know that it's because the law wasn't enforced? The solution is to put a bit of muscle into enforcing the laws we have now. You wouldn't be this guy, would you?  Oh, no, my house is on fire! I better throw some gasoline onto it!  ...  Oh, no, that made it worse! There's some trees there that could burn the entire neighborhood down if they catch, so I better throw some more gas onto it!  ...  Why isn't it working? You, over there! Yeah, you!

fact_215	fact	This obviously depends on the person. Both are not good...once again, a comparision is not gonna work. Whether you are an alcoholic or a weed-a-holic(not a real word) you will still mess up your health (which is a good reason we shouldn't have public health care).
fact_573	fact	And yet the article is about a legal matter.
fact_1842	fact	Well at least in the US you can't. Also in the US if a law suit is brought it is normaly not about getting treatment it's about pain a suffering compensation. In the US if you bring a law suit there is virtualy no risk of having to pay the defendants legal fees if they win so there is no risk to the person or law firm in bringing a suit. This is why frivilous law suits are rampent in the US. Most insurance companies will settle a suit than take it to trial since it costs less to settle.
fact_2393	fact	"Since when? So if I were to post a news article where someone says that pedophilia should be legalized, then it means I agree with them? I thought this was a discussion board. That means we, you know, DISCUSS THINGS.  Now, if I had said ""Here is AiG's article and I couldn't agree with them more"", then you would have an argument.  As I did not, you don't. Now, do you retract your false statement that what you quoted was my reasoning?"
fact_82	fact	"Well, to be ""scientific"" means that it must be falsifiable. Otherwise it is meaningless in a regime of methodological naturalism."
fact_2387	fact	"I believe that's true, and as a ""believer"" (creationist), here is what is hard to understand about that; In Matthew, 12:30, Jesus says ""He who is not with me is against me, and he who does not gather with me scatters"". It is safe to say that both creationists and theistic evolutionists would accept that statement from Jesus, and would seek to be ""with"" him, while agnostic and atheists would consider themselves ""not with"" him. Yet theistic evolutionists are comfortable to (usually politically) be ""with"" agnostics and atheists, and separate themselves from creationists. If they're genuine Christians, knowing about the warnings in the Bible about false teachings, how can they be comfortable with that?  Miller laments in several places throughout the book that atheists use evolution as a weapon against religion, and that it shouldn't be that way - that it causes more strife between the two than should exist."
fact_96	fact	"Well, that was a bait-and-switch but it wasn't very masterful. Actually, there are two color morphs in arctic foxes that are determined by a single locus. You are incorrect to claim that the brown morph becomes pure white. That is incorrect. It becomes a very light brown and appears to have a blue sheen. That is why it is known as the ""blue morph"". The ""white morph"" is a light brownish gray in summer and becomes pure white in winter. However, the fact that arctic foxes do (not can) change color seasonally is not evolution. All arctic foxes always do change color with the seasons (it happens much quicker than the ""matter of months"" that you state), and that isn't evolution. It is evolution that the arctic foxes, like many other northern and arctic animals like the Mustelidae, have evolved the ability to change colors with the seasons."
fact_567	fact	We can make machines that can interpret information that our unaided eye can't. They don't have to dismantle anything.
fact_1856	fact	"Actually, it is a mutation. Just like the color of the fur is a mutation. Polar bear fur is not white, it is colorless. Moreover, it is hollow. That is another mutation. And Polar bears have longer legs than their closest relatives, the brown bears. They have smaller ears. None of the changes are caused by ""friction"".  By the way, the webs between the toes of a Polar bear are very much like the webs between the toes of a duck.  Adaptation is, by the way, evolution. I presume that is the word you meant to use. Adaptation is not adaption. You talk about the process as if it were adaption and then call it adaptation. In reality it is adaptation."
fact_201	fact	addition works in the intangible as well. 1 minute + 1 minute = 2 minutes. 1 idea + 1 idea = 2 ideas. the concept of quantity is not limited to matter.   if there was just a vaccous void were absolutely nothing was happening, then there would be no application of logic. but even that in itself would be logical. nothing + nothing = nothing is logical. it would actually be logical if a void with nothing added to it result in something. so even in a void, logic still prevails
fact_229	fact	"No one said he invented guns!  A straw man argument is an informal fallacy based on misrepresentation of an opponent's position.[1] To ""attack a straw man"" is to create the illusion of having refuted a proposition by substituting a superficially similar proposition (the ""straw man""), and refuting it, without ever having actually refuted the original position.[1][2]"
fact_2152	fact	"Reversing a decision would occur at what you might call the ""law"" level. Amending the Constitution is at a different level, and so doesn't count as a reversal."
fact_1329	fact	That's EXACTLY the point. Regardless of whether or not human minds think differently, whichever mind produced and agrees that 2+2=4 is absolutely correct, the rest are wrong.   We know this because we can observe and test the concept in the physical world and prove that it is true.   This goes for just about anything, dissention in the face of facts does not change the facts.  IMHO, this invalidates your claim that something produced in the human mind is not absolute due to some human minds being contradictory.
fact_2146	fact	"""refuted?""  O'rly?   First they start off defining evolution as ""moleclues to man"" despite what evolution actually states. That further proves my point about strawman. They don't discuss what evolution actually is. Furthermore, the whole notion that increasing capacity and adaption is not increasing complexity is insane. If I take a simple structure, modify it to form something more complex, is that not a change in complexity? The whole idea that modifying DNA, changing it, removing and adding isn't actually changing anything is retarded.   And they are separating macro from micro. That's an invalid argument given that macro is nothing more then the aggregate of micro. A billion tiny changes makes a few large ones.   The second idiotic article cites Natural genetic engineering. Despite there being absolutely no evidence of this occuring anywhere."
fact_1467	fact	"Well that is a problem for the ardent creationist isn't it? Or for any Christian. The Bible says that God cannot lie.   Tts 1:2 In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began;   Num 23:19 God [is] not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent: hath he said, and shall he not do [it]? or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good?   You see the Bible says that God promises never to send a flood to destroy the whole earth again:  Gen 9:15 And I will remember my covenant, which [is] between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.   If the flood were a local flood, as some say, then God is a liar. There have been many local floods througout history. If God is a liar, then the Bible is not the word of God and cannot be trusted.   Consider this excercise in logic:  If God is who he says he is in the Bible, and his very voice created the universe, then can God lie? If light didn't exist, and then God said let there be light and light then existed -- if there is that sort of creative power in the Word of God -- can God lie? Imagine if you had that kind of power in your voice. Whatever you said became true for all eternity. If you contradicted yourself, one reality would be destroyed for another, wouldn't it? If God said ""let there be light, and there was light"" where light had not been before, then what would happen if God were to lie about the earth? Wouldn't the former be destroyed and the new become reality?  In the Bible, Jesus says ""I am the way, the Truth, and the light"". How can someone ""be"" the truth, unless they are a God with the power of creation in their voice. You see, if any part of the Bible is a lie, then the whole idea of God and Jesus comes crumbling down like a house of cards."
fact_956	fact	"And many news stories have referred to the New York shooter as being armed with a ""high powered rifle"" despite the fact that this was blatantly false. Why should we take this story as being fully factual about the details of background checks and gun shows?  And a lot of newspapers are repeating the claims that fully-automatic machine guns, anti-tank missiles, fragmentation grenades and rocket launchers, are being bought by mexican drug cartel members -even though they couldn't possibly pass a background check- and that they're being bought from gun stores in America! But no matter how many times we demand proof of such, NONE IS EVER PRESENTED!  Come back with undeniable proof that FFL dealers never conduct federally mandated background checks when selling guns at gun shows, otherwise don't post on the topic anymore since you have nothing but lies and scare mongering tactics."
fact_1301	fact	Exactly and if you accept that animals have been on the Earth for millions of years then why can't evolution be a process that God created and controls?

Until you can show that happenstance origins are science, you have no basis to declare that intelligent design is not science. I agree that I haven't shown how ID has a potential advantage to the political corruptness of today's scientific community, but I've shown it's potential advantage to our society. I've shown how thinking is involved with it, the type of thinking involved in any school class involving philosophy, which you said science classes should have.
fact_942	fact	I think you got it backwards Kelvin. You're the one that said you wouldn't let your children play with toy guns because you're afraid that your children wouldn't be able to tell the difference between a real gun and a toy gun. Blindone never advocated toy gun-control. On the contrary, Blindone was pointing out that toy guns don't harm children.  And if your children can't tell the difference between fantasy and reality how do you expect them to handle a gun responsibly? They might try to shoot the boogey man or their own shadow.
fact_2191	fact	"The flying spaghetti monster is similar to the term ""flat earthers"" - ridicule without substance. It's much more recent however. It was concocted in June of 2005 by one Bobby Henderson, a young college graduate with a degree in physics. He wrote it as a joke, as a response when the Kansas board of education took up the question of the teaching of ID in schools. That web page is a long one, with all the little pictures & everything. It probably started more simply than that, and grew after it became the cult hit that it did. It got attention on many other websites, and in the press as well. The Washington Post reprinted it word for word, and a New York Times headline read ""But is there intelligent spaghetti out there?"" With that kind of publicity for a view that desperately gropes for talking points, it's not surprising that it comes up in many debates here. We should be able to get far beyond it in this debate - are you prepared? :) Both terms, ""flat earthers"" and ""spaghetti monster"" seem to come up much more often than ""happenstance origins"", or even ""Darwinism"", a 150 year old concept that's troubled by several recent discoveries. Happenstance origins is a serious term - I used it in my opening affirmative argument, and you haven't touched it. Can you?"

fact_981	fact	"Actually, Darwin didn't like the phrase ""survival of the fittest"" applied to his theory. The phrase was actually coined by sociologist Herbert Spencer in the statement of his social theories. Darwin's preferred phrase was ""natural selection"" and used the phrase ""survival of the fittest"" only after it had become popular and Alfred Wallace (a Christian turned spiritualist) convinced Darwin that he would avoid confusion by using it. If one wants to reduce the hundreds of pages of theory that Darwin wrote to a single sound bite, ""differential reproductive success"" is probably the best. Further, natural selection was a proposed mechanism to explain the observed divergence of species.  Darwin was quite aware of the implications of his theory for mankind from the beginning. He was also aware that it would be unpopular with the Church and the religious so he didn't mention it in On the Origin of Species. He waited until the theories expressed in that book had become generally accepted in the scientific community and then published The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex. In the later book Darwin did argue that mankind shared a common ancestor with apes."

fact_994	fact	Genes transfered horizontally are as subject to selection as anyother form of gene. Once intergrated into the recieving genome they are simply one more heritable element and if they alter the phenotypes (many are either neutral or even inactivatee) then of course they are subject to selection. Why do you think otherwise? Remember that horizontal transfer is a rare event roughly on a par with ordinary mutations.
fact_2184	fact	"You forgot the evolution of the motorcar, the evolution of Christianity, the evolution of the computer, the evolution of the trumpet, the evolution of...  The word evolution is used in everyday terms to mean change (normally for the better). Biological evolution, ie the theory of evolution, is unrelated to this everyday use of the term. ""Astronomical evolution"", just like ""Trumpet evolution"" has nothing to do with the theory of evolution. When you grasp this simple concept, you will have made your first step toward becoming knowledgable about the theory. At the moment, you are stuck on the start line boasting about the end of the race: you are a YEC supporter in other words."

fact_2190	fact	The maintenance of the integrity of the code is not dependent on selection, but dependent on internal variables (feedback system) for maintaining functional integrity. Again, showing another form of optimality.  In article 10:  Fascinating research was conducted whereby a sundry of different unnatural amino acids with novel three and four base codons have been selectively incorporated (engineered) into proteins yielding viable organisms.  An intriguing question arises from this research. It is easy to imagine these to arise through chance and selection (e.g. amino acids with photoaffinity) and then be incorporated into the standard code. Yet the code seems to remain stagnant. For billions of year after fixation, little evolution happened in the code. Why?   Did it arrive at a global optimum in a pre-existing fitness landscape, with a pre-existing fitness function?  Finally, Article 11:  The article cites many of the optimal properties above and concludes:

fact_1472	fact	It depends on your intention and your methods. Of course, things that don't have some sort of physical manifestation that can be measured can't be studied by science. Science is naturalistic. Scientific data can only include that which can be observed and quantified by natural means. I read it in a book of mythology isn't scientific.
fact_957	fact	"If anyone is pushing ID, YEC is an issue. ID as a ""foot in the door"" maneuver in an effort to teach science.

You seem to fit that picture pretty well."

fact_1328	fact	I think that you should check with cosmologists, astrophysicists, astronomers and the like to see why most scientists accept the findings of those sciences, even evolutionists. I suggest you read some books.  The Whole Shebang: A State-of-the-Universe(s) Report by Timothy Ferris, emeritus professsor at UC Berkeley. A really good writer, Ferris has taught courses in journalism and science writing, as well as english, philosophy, and astronomy - a total of 5 diciplines at 4 universities.  Other books that may help you to understand the topic are:  Wrinkles in Time by George Smoot and Keay Davidson. The book is a report on the COBE experiments that verified the predicted unevenness of the background radiation. A good explanation of cosmology in general.  The Elegant Universe and The Fabric of the Cosmos by Brian Greene. These books require some scientific savy, so they may be a bit too difficult for you.

It's why there has been an effort in recent years to close the loophole with a constitutional amendment defining marriage."
fact_2392	fact	"""As President CalderÃ³n and I discussed, I am urging the Senate in the United States to ratify an inter-American treaty known as CIFTA to curb small arms trafficking that is a source of so many of the weapons used in this drug war,"" President Obama proclaimed in Mexico City last month. He also incorrectly repeated the errant statistic that 90 percent of guns in the hands of Mexican drug cartels come from America. (In actuality, according to ATF special agent William Newell, about 17 percent of guns associated with crime in Mexico came from the United States. And this figure has not been broken down to see how many came from civilian gun shops and how many were purchased from the U.S. military by Mexico's government.) ""We're going to be very focused on this. It's going to be a top priority."" ABC News quoted an administration official who said that Obama ""felt that it was important to push now for the ratification of this treaty because the question of illegal small-arms is of great concern to the countries throughout the hemisphere a[s] it affects their safety.â  You have the ATFE Assistant Director William Hoover spouting the 90% figure, Then everyone up and on down jumping on board with it. Then ATF special agent William Newell corrects the figure and goes on to state they don't know how many came from the private sector and how many came from the US Gov giving them to Mexico.   Yet we are supposed to punish the law abiding because other countries either can't or won't get control of their criminals."
fact_1843	fact	actually, thats not logic, but its closely related. of course, if you stick your hand in fire it will get burned. logic dictates that the sum of initial energy must equal sum of final energy. etc etc  you are very right that logic is predictable and constant. this is exactly why logic diametrically opposes god. a body of water cannot divide itself and leave a dry path down the center unless god something to defy logical law. because gravity exists, its logical for water or any fluid to be drawn by gravity to the lowest level possible. there is nothing miraculous about the common and predictable properties of water under the force of gravity, so god isnt needed to explain it because logic already has  if, however, that body of water behaves in a way that logic cannot explain, then we can almost positively assume that such is the intervention of god. the only acts that can be accredited to god, in the bible, are those where something illogical occured

fact_1102	fact	Well, man might someday gain the capability of fully synthasizing a molecule as complex as DNA from scratch. Of course, he would use the knowledge gained from studying how various DNA codes affect natural biological characteristics in order to properly design that DNA to achieve the desired characteristics. It might be even more difficult to then take that synthesized DNA and put it in an egg and artificial womb that has no natural (as opposed to artificial) biological parts, but even that might be achievable someday through chemical construction. All this means is that humanity might someday be able to copy the methods of nature to create a new being - perhaps even use creativity to create beings of very different natural functions than we see in our world.  It is all interesting to think about and could well be achievable within this century. We already are capable of a large degree of genetic manipulation through cloning and hybridization. One would think that it will only be a matter of time before more complex technologies get developed.  The other question, of course, is - If we could someday create new life using our technology, should we? That would bring up a whole host of issues, including:  - Would we know what we were doing well enough not to cause great harm?  - How would the beings we create be treated?
fact_1664	fact	Well, since the composition of the uranium body when it was a natural reactor wasn't the same as today's natural uranium, it doesn't matter. What is important was the composition of the ore back then. Since U-238 has a half-life of 4.468E+9 years and U-235 has a half-life of 7.038E+8 years, it is apparent that the U-235 decays much more rapidly. It stands to reason that the The relative percentage of U-235 to U-238 was higher in the past. It also stands to reason that thee was more uranimum present at the time that the natural reactors were active. About 2 billion years ago the U-235 was about 3% or more of the composition of the uranium.
fact_54	fact	"C.S.Lewis believes things on faith, yet we are to use his words, which he is not here to clarify, as evidence that my claim is false, when he obviously accepts the same illogical claim as premise?

""We're an accident? OMG, then we must right!""."
fact_2345	fact	Also keep in mind that some changes can happen quickly if you select for a quality that's already present in the population. Something like beak size will following a bell curve. Most beaks close to average size, some larger than average, some smaller. If pressures change so that those with below average beak size gain some advantage than they can exploit it instantly. From the word go they will be eating better and be more healthy than their big beaked cousins, and so more likely to breed successfully come next breeding season. And if the little beakers are the most successful breeders than we would expect to see alot of little beaks in the next generation. Basically, the genetic variety is already present in the population, so exploiting that variety can happen quickly.

fact_1937	fact	No. That's not what I said. I said that natural selection is differential reproductive success. I said that those organisms that possessed advantageous characteristics would tend to reach reproductive age more frequently and therefore they will tend to produce more offspring, while those with disadvantageous characteristics will tend to produce fewer offspring. As a result, the heritable characteristics of the population will change over time.
fact_1704	fact	Well to start its a theory not a notion. Secondly if everybody already agreed on common ancestry with modification as the means whereby the species arose then why did anyone every think Darwin had anything new and novel. Simple explanation is he explained HOW such descent might be accomplished in a rational and testable context and provided significant evidence and analysis supporting his scheme. In other words his basic scheme coheres while the alternatives fail to do so.

What these folks DONT realise, is that all firearms transfers made by licensed dealers are required bt BATF regulation to be recorded in the dealer ""bound book"" of firearm transfers. Federal law says they are required to keep these books forever, or if they fail to renew their FFL, they are required to send the bound book to the ATF. Also by federal law, they are required to make that bound book available to the ATF at any time, without a warrant, in order to facilitate the tracing of firearms.   A nationwide datebase of firearm owners is already HERE. It is just fragmented into a bunch of smaller parts and kept by gun dealers instead of in a central database. All it would take is a trip o each gun stor, and they would have a list of everybody who has bought a gun from a licensed dealer.  As far as police tracking black market guns, it doesn't seem to work now, and I fai to see how they are going to do any better at it int he future.

Gravitational theory however is a woefully weak theory. Beyond the facts that mass has no effect upon the rate of descent, we can send probes to Saturn's moons using our knowledge of gravity and gravity effects time, we know next to diddly squat about it. We do not know how it works. It doesn't even appear to work properly over large siatnces, the universe is expanding at the wrong rate according to our gravitational calculations, we invent dark matter and dark energy (neithe rof which has been detected) to explain gaping hole sin the theory and the entire theory is at odds with quantum theory. So why don't Kansas shcools teach about alternate theories in physics classes when covering gravity?  The answer of course is simple: evolution is questioned to appease the religious fundamentalists that still hold your country to ransom by the balls. Don't give me this nonsense about ""evolutionist zealots"": they are simply scientists p***ed off with weak school boards cowering at the the first sign of the fundies getting upset over their kids being taught current scientific knowledge, rather than religious mythology, in science classes.

Not being a science worshiper myself, I simply donât automatically take this type of blanket statement as automatically true.

Unusual of course, but if we have scientific blunders concerning a few miles, I can imagine we could have a few blunders concerning hundreds of thousands of light years.

fact_1270	fact	No it does not. God never attempted to provide proof anyway, aside from the testimony of a few witnesses. He leaves it to every person to decide for himself and believe in him or not. He requires that we believe in him without solid evidence based solely on the changed lives of those who do believe. Anyone who searches for indisputable evidence of Godâs existence will not find it. There will be no physical evidence, no wonders, no miracles, no voice from the sky. You will only see God working in the lives of people or within your own life. That is the basis of faith. To believe what you cannot see.

fact_827	fact	"Nearly all animal phyla* made their first appearance in the fossil record at essentially the same time, an interval of some 5 million years [ET**] (about 525 to 530 million years ago [ET**]) called the ""Cambrian Explosion.""51  Scientists have found that these early fossils exhibit more anatomical body designs than exist today, and that early animals, the trilobites, had eyes as fully developed as their counterparts today.38  Many of the Cambrian fauna, still survive today, all looking much like they did over 500 million [ET**] years ago. The prominent British evolutionist, Richard Dawkins, comments, ""... [W]e find many of them already in an advanced state of evolution, the very first time they appear. It is as though they were just planted there, without any evolutionary history.""51  Two places in the world that have an abundance of early (Cambrian) fossils; the Burgess Shale in the Canadian Rockies and the Chengjiang site in China.38  In Stephen J. Gould's popular book, Wonderful Life, he points out that the Burgess Shale Cambrian fossils include ""a range of disparity in anatomical design never again equaled, and not matched today by all the creatures in the world's oceans.""38   Further, these fossils contain some twenty to thirty kinds of arthropods*** that cannot be placed in any modern group. The modern arthropods, consisting of almost a million species, can all fit into four major groups. But ""one quarry in British Columbia, representing the first explosion of multicellular life, reveals more than twenty additional arthropod designs."" Today there are about 38 phyla in existence, but the Canadian, Chinese and other Cambrian sites reveal over fifty phyla.38  There has been a decrease in diversity (probably due to global catastrophes). This is the reverse of what evolutionary theory predicts.38  Besides diversity, the Burgess Shale shows exquisite detail, right down to ""the last filament of a trilobite's gill,"" or the last meal in a worm's gut.38  The Chengjiang site has even greater detail, and is earlier. According to Paul Chien, the chairman of the biology department at the University of San Francisco, said the preservation is such that internal organs, nerves, and even the water ducts of jellyfish are observable.38  Researchers found striking similarities between the compound eyes of the Cambrian trilobites and those of modern insects. According to Riccardo Levi-Setti, ""Trilobites could see in their immediate environment with amazingly sophisticated optical devices in the form of large composite eyes. ... The number of individual optical elements in the compound eye could vary from approximately one hundred to more than fifteen thousand in a single eye, a range not very different from that found in modern insects.""38  The conclusion is that the eye, a complex visual system, was fully formed and functional extremely early in the fossil record. Obviously, this is not predicted by evolutionary theory.38  Until recently, the phylum of vertebrates had been considered a later arrival in evolutionary history. But not now! Even the vertebrate phylum now extends into the Cambrian period, especially with the recent discovery of two fossil fish in China.51  The two new fossils . . . from Chengjiang are the most convincing Early Cambrian vertebrates ever found. The insects and other land invertebrates are also a very important group, and these practically all seem to be living fossils.51  These complex animals were present at the beginning of multicellular life and did not appear later as is predicted by evolutionary theory.38  Evolution does not explain the abrupt appearance of complex forms of life early in the fossil record or these fossils' unequaled diversity. The implication of the Cambrian explosion of diverse, fully functional, and multicellular life is that evolutionary theory is falsified.38  Life did not start out simple and evolve into more complex and diverse animals; it was complex and diverse right at the beginning. This contradiction between the fossil data and the predictions of evolutionary theory falsifies the theory.38  ""The facts of paleontology seem to support creation rather than evolution. All the major groups of invertebrates appear suddenly in the first fossiliferous strata. (Cambrian) of the earth with their distinct specializations, indicating that they were all created at almost the same time."" - David Enock Associate Professor of Biology. BS Yeshiva College, MS Hunter College50  Even George Gaylord Simpson, Harvard high priest of evolution had to admit, âIn spite of the examples, it remains true (as every paleontologist knows) that most new species, genera and families appear in the record suddenly, and are not led up to by known, gradual, completely continuous transitional sequences.â50   http://www.straight-talk.net/evolution/explosion.htm"

What's funny is our state government outlawed over-the-counter sale of some of the primary ingredients for cooking crank in an effort to combat it on the cheap. Yep, all those ingredients are now smuggled in, reducing local retail revenue and we've also experienced an increase of cheap Mexican crank on the street.

That's what you fail to appreciate by continuing to insist that 'science says' fossil hominids are our ancestors. Science says no such thing. Science says this was Planet of the Apes - and we won.  Why are there still chimps, then? Because they weren't competing with us. Think: the same ecological reasons why chimps couldn't evolve our level of intelligence made it not worth our while to fight them for that territory. Doesn't that make beautiful, perfect sense? Only since we've started exporting our ecology, cutting down jungles and so on - only since then have we come into competition with them, to their cost. If we're not careful, the answer to the fatuous question ""If we evolved from chimps, why are there still chimps"" will be ""there aren't"".  It's silly to attach significance to the fact we're the 'only' intelligent species. For a start, we're not the 'only' - we're the first. Intelligence - our 'level' of it - was never inevitable; it's not some ultimate goal, any more than swimming or flying. But assuming it happens, someone has to be first, and we're it. Secondly, we're not the 'only' - we're the most. So far. And we're getting smarter - so don't be so quick to declare us the pinnacle; you have no idea what peaks are hidden in the clouds ahead. If we're lucky, in a million years the smartest creature will be one of our descendants, but it could just as easily be whatever creature emerges to claim the territory we leave behind when we become extinct.

So you want people to just ignore the plain text of the Second Amendment- at least the part you don't like. The preamble lets us know that the main focus if not the sole focus of this amendment is the militia.   David Konig is another historian that has found both the individual rights interpretation and the collective interpretation unsatisfactory. He says the Second Amendment protects an individual right that is exercised collectively.   ""Indeed, to serve in the militia and participate in this civic duty was more than a duty: it was a civic right of a peculiarly eighteenth-century nature unlike either the 'individual' or 'collective' models argued for today. On neither side of the Atlantic, that is, did the debate concern itself with this right in the present-day sense of an 'individual' or personal constitutional right; but at the same time, its common emphasis on widespread individual arms-bearing for public service distinguishes it from today's narrowly applied 'collective' application to the National Guard. No individual right existed unrelated to service in a well-regulated militia; no effective militia could serve its purpose without an armed citizenry. This type of right may appear paradoxical to us today, but it fitted 'the inner coherence of a given system of beliefs'4 held by people in the past, and which made sense to those familiar with the concept of an individual right exercised collectively.""

There was no ""sneaking"" on any level. PZ, his daughter, and I all registered our names over the internet for the event and selected the option to have up to three guests come with us. We registered our real names, our real addresses, our real telephone numbers, and our real emails, and we all received confirmation emails approving our registration.  3.) What possible reason did they have to deny PZ a viewing of the film? Dawkins and I pressed the producer Mathis on this issue, and he said it was about money -- he wanted PZ to come back in a month and pay his $10. But this makes no sense. PZ was paid $1,200 for his interview. They thanked him for the interview in the credits. If money was a concern, they could have paid him $1,190 and given him a free reservation. Just the fact that he was in the film should have been enough to warrant a seat at a pre-screening event.  This all begs the question: What in God's name are they so bloody afraid of?"

Of the several ""different scientific diciplines"" refered to above, they all have one thing in common since there is only one basic alternative to intelligent design, and that's undirected, random, happenstance processes. For purposes of this debate, can we come up with one general two word phrase for the ""different scientific diciplines"" - a phrase perfectly comparable to intelligent design, which ""theory of evolution"" is clearly not? How about ""happenstance origins""? Since you declare that intelligent design is not science, you have to have a criteria for science that intelligent design doesn't fit. Does ""happenstance origins"" fit the same criteria? If there is no way to test or falsify intelligent design, there is no way to test or falsify happenstance origins. If intelligent design isn't repeatable, happenstance origins aren't repeatable. Other scientists can't apply a scientific method to happenstance origins to get the same kind of results as the original scientist, and on and on. Evolutionists imply that with time, they may be able to scientifically get to the bottom of happenstance origins. That's no more (or less) plausible than intelligent design advocates claim to be able to scientifically get to the bottom of intelligent design. If you demand to know how we can prove intelligent design is false or true before we consider it as science, why can't the same be asked of you before you consider the progressive steps of happenstance origins to be science?

Ted Turner, the multi-billionaire, has also donated millions to others, and guess what grizzly6626, he's an atheist too!   George Soros, also a multi-billionaire, financier and philanthropist, has also donated millions and is also an atheist. The list goes on and on. You just don't hear about these people donating because they tend to do these things quietly, and not with a lot of *cough* religious *cough* fanfare.  Didn't mean to wake you up grizzly6626 emoticonXBye  BTW - many catholic charities are known to turn the needy away. I've heard many accounts about how when some people first got married back in the 1970s, that catholic charities wouldn't help them out because they were not ""good, church-going catholics."" Basically because they didn't go to church every week (and put in their money filled envelope) the Church didn't consider them worthy of help.  You see, it isn't because religion makes people morally better than atheism. Rather, it would be because churches often organize charitable activities and encourage their members to participate, while atheists, simply have no comparable social structure. It's not that churchgoers have a superior moral sentiment, just that because of their increased social structure they naturally have increased opportunity.  There are countless amounts of people who are atheist that donate from the heart. They do not 'band together' into groups like religions do, and they do not advertise their charitable works like religions do, but they donate from the heart just the same. Here is a partial list of many such individuals who just happen to also be atheist. But it goes MUCH further than that though. There are a few organizations formed by atheists for the sole purpose of donating to those in need. One such organization is called S.H.A.R.E. - Secular Humanist Aid and Relief Effort. Here is a recent story about them helping those in need. So, when someone ignorant and closed-minded like grizzly6626 tries to convince you that 'only religions' donate or help those in need, you will now know that it's simply not true, and that people from all beliefs, even those that don't believe in God, help others in need and donate from their hearts, because they know it's the right thing to do for their fellow man in need emoticonXIdea"

fact_204	fact	"Another characteristic in this same general area that ties us back to fish is the development of our parathyroid glands - which are very similar to gill buds in fish - from a particular pharyngeal arch: the same one that in fish gives rise to the gill buds!  Moving on to the kidneys for a minute. The human embryo forms not one, but 3 successive kidneys: the pronephric, mesonephric, and metanephric kidneys. Only that last one persists and only it is the kidney you and I and all of our fellow humans use. Why do human embryos go through two transient and simpler kidneys before getting it right? Here's a hint: the other two are carry overs from simpler organisms! The evolutionarily simplest vertebrates, such as hagfish and teleost fish, develop only the pronephric kidney: it is their adult functional kidney. Now move up an evolutionary notch to (other) fish and amphibians. In their embryos, the first kidney still develops, but soon begins to degenerate and is replaced by the mesonephric kidney, which is the functional adult kidney in these organisms. Now move up another evolutionary notch, to reptiles, birds, and mammals. Their embryos form the first kidney, which then degenerates and is replaced by the second kidney, which then degenerates and is replaced by the final, metanephric kidney: their adult functional kidney.  The above is not anywhere near a complete list of embryological evidences for common descent/evolution.  PS: Note the serial addition of developmental stages that occurs in kidneys as one moves up to higher evolutionary levels: ""ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny"". Of course this ""law"" does not hold for all organs/organ systems in all organisms, but it does hold for a few cases. And that's enough to clearly indicate evolution of those organ systems by their being retained from ancestors and then modified during embryonic development."

Until relatively recently within the history of humankind, the Romans adhered to the rule of paterfamilia in which the supreme patriarch of a clan--oh, how they loved their males, men were next to God in their eyes, a tradition which lives on within the Roman Catholic Church--ruled on the existence of infants within his clan. If he chose, this next to God male, the infant lived and received shelter and nurturance. If he chose not, the child was abandoned to sate the hunger of wild animals or, perhaps, might be saved by a kindly human wayfarer. In many cases these wayfarers were not so kind and the child may have been severely abused, used as a sexual toy--hmmm, kind of reminds me of the situation for inner city children in very Roman Catholic Brazil.

He knew what the consequences of his theory, that flew in the face of the geocentric dogma of the ""queen of the sciences"", would be. Giordano Bruno and Galileo both found out the consequences of stating theories that were in conflict with the ""queen of the sciences."" Only when science broke free of the domination by the Church were scientists free to follow the data to the conclusions rather than begin with the conclusions did real science develop and begin to develope real scientific theories. ""Creation science"" still begins with the conclusions and then tries to find data that will fit the dogma, even if it is sometimes contradictory. In ""creation science"" there is no hyopthesis, no prediction, and not test with the power to falsify the hypothesis. ""Creation science"" is pseudoscience."

fact_990	fact	"NO! There are facts present that cannot possibly be true IF SS's theory is correct! That's the point.   OK, let's go back to basic deductive logic:  True statements cannot have false consequences. In symbolic logic:  If H then C  not C  Therefore: not H  That is, we have hypothesis H. It has consequences C. If you find that C is either not there or that there are consequences contradictory to C, then H is false.  Neandertals and humans are lumped in one ""kind"" by creationists. Elephants and mammoths are another ""kind"". Now, if SS's theory is true, neandertals will have the same DNA sequences as humans, because it is a matter what genes are turned on and when, not a change of genes. (This is even more pronounced because creationists insist neandertals ARE members of H. sapiens). Same for mammoths and elephants. So now we look at DNA sequences. Are they the same? NO! Neandertals and H. sapiens differ by over 3 standard deviations from variation within H. sapiens populations. So, the consequences are wrong, therefore SS's hypothesis is wrong.  No assumptions involved. Only data."
fact_984	fact	Because their axiom is that the bible is infallible, so any problems with reading it are the reader's fault, whereas yours is that contradiction implies error. What Ken's saying is that we can't draw a distinction between your axioms and those of a bible literalist in terms of which is 'right', because axioms are stated not proved: axioms define what is 'right'.  To reiterate: his error is in forgetting that the universe operates according to its own axioms, whatever they may be, and we can judge whether or not our axioms are congruent.

fact_774	fact	It would be 'an' analogy, but like the language analogy, it has its limitations.  It is interesting to note that creationist computer software developers/programmers cannot seem to agree on the implications of 'mutations' when using such analogies - one such person, C.K. Lester, declared that computer programs can accumulate up to 30% 'random change', just like DNA (hypothetically) can, therefore, the computer analogy is a good one. But programmer R. David Pogge declares that even a single altered bit in a line of computer code a million bits in length would destroy it.

Even less of a feather might shade a pool of water to allow them to spot small fish or for display to attract a potential mate. To say they were ""totally useless"", is simply false.

fact_761	fact	"there is no doubt the human body is all about manifestation of energy, not just electrical. just saying ""hi"" is creating sound energy through the kinetic energy of your jaw muscles, lung and vocal cords, which was converted from the chemical energy stored in the food you ate.   but proving that energy occurs in the human body does not address the question of life itself. If life itself is a form of energy, then it must either be constant at all times (ie, cannot be created or destroyed). Or, it can be converted from one form to another. or both..."
fact_775	fact	"There's just enough truth in that statement to keep me from saying it's false, but if I analyze it, it will help make my point;  The word ""evolution"" has such a broad meaning that it doesn't have to mean atheism, but it since it is practically the only weapon that atheists have to combat the religious worldview, that's what it often DOES mean. If it shouldn't mean it, but it is used so that it does, then that's what it actually means.  Creationism means religion, but it also involves a belief in the authenticity of historical documents that have been meticulously preserved over thousands of years. That's not just religion, it's secular, observed history - something evolution doesn't have.   So if a person hearing your statement doesn't consider it carefully, it's very easy to be mislead by it. It implies that ""evolution"" (the branch that declares that the book of Genesis is false) is somehow a secular, observable truth - while creationism is nothing but a religion, a superstition. Since evolution can't prove the book of Genesis (ancient history) false, and creationism does have some historical backing, they are comparable and they directly conflict.  The problem is, a school teacher can make the statement you made, and it can't be legally questioned by anyone. Yet there was a case that I read about somewhere, where a sticker was placed in science textbooks advising children to study evolution ""with an open mind"", and an ACLU lawsuit ensued. Of all those likely to be mislead by your statement, it's young impressionable school children. Publicly paid school teachers misleading them with statements like that, without a full explanation (prohibited by the courts) does get an establishment of atheism started. It's what I mean when I say that when church and state are separated, atheism and state are combined. Maybe government could be neutral, if it was small. The U.S. government is no longer small."
fact_2195	fact	Just helping something live doesn't affect evolution unless it affects the ability to reproduce viable offspring.   If there was no nylon before the 1940s and there is an organism that can survive by eating NOTHING else, what does that tell you? There could not have been a population of nylon-eating bacteria before 1940. This is a new population that did not exist before.

The bacteria and enzymes in your gut and intestinal tract that digest food are every bit as microscopic, and they thrive on specific compounds, not elements. Sugars and fats are plain old carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. You could get exactly the same atoms into your body by drinking water and eating graphite - and you'd die. Can you digest cellulose? No - but other animals can, because they have enzymes that can break it down. It's still all just carbon, oxygen and hydrogen - but that's like saying everybody's front door key is just 'brass'. It isn't the fact that it's brass that unlocks your door, it's the shape it's formed into :)

fact_2142	fact	"I don't usually agree with you, but I agree with you on this one. The judiciary branch is there to interpret the law. Do I wish the ruling had been different and the government should have paid for the abortion? Yes. But the court made the correct decision. It's the same with the Terri Schiavo case. All the conservatives wanted to save her because they thought the laws weren't right but the judges all sided on the side of the law. The law is written for a reason, and we don't get to decide when to ignore them just because of compassion. Then we fall down the slippery slope of abridging the first amendment because it's better, and violating other laws ""for the good of the people"". It's like ""Animal Farm"", where the laws kept changing ever so slightly, and soon it was no better than it was before. The laws were made, and if we want to change them, we should fight them, but court is not the place. Of course we all wish we could just go to the courts and get them to settle disputes like mommy but they are there to interpret the law, and unfortunately the law was very clear here, that in this case the government should not pay for the abortion."
fact_1339	fact	Not between nonrandom variation and directed variation: between nonrandom amounts of variation, and directed variation.  For instance, if I heat up a kettle of water, the motion of the liquid becomes more violent. The amount of motion is non-random, linked as it is to the temperature of the water, but the motion itself is random.  Is that satisfactory?  Taking things a step further, we can also observe that the motion of the water, while random, is nevertheless constrained by the kettle. This is analogous to the 'developmental constraints' mentioned in the article you quote. I confess to seeing nothing problematic for the ToE in the idea that natural selection would favour genomes that are less susceptible to some mutations than to others.
fact_2156	fact	Well I'm pretty sure if it was cyber-enhancements then that dog never would have been born for you to see. It would be in a lab somewhere.

A year goes by, scientists say it was genuine evolution. Would that be enough evidence?

fact_946	fact	"No, it's not.   The conditions under which evolution operated during the Cambrian/Vendian times were different from the conditions following that time in two main ways, and these differences can potentially account for the origin of the many animal body plans during those early periods and the lack of new ones since.   First, ~540 million years ago most animals were very much simpler (fewer cells, for example) than they are today, so changes to their developmental programs would have been better tolerated. The more complex any system is (the more parts it has, and the more coordinated and well-matched those parts must be, etc.), the more rigidly constrained and less amenable to a given magnitude of change it is. So the simpler developmental processes (simpler adult-form end product, fewer interactions between developmental genes, etc.) of early animals would have allowed for a 'large-scale' change to be incorporated into that animal's ontogeny, though if a change of the same magnitude were to occur today, it would be too disruptive to the complex developmental program and would be eliminated (note that 'large-scale change' refers to the adult form: the actual change that caused that altered end result could be a typical small scale mutation, in an early developmental stage). This it not to propose Goldschmidt's ""hopeful monsters"" that occur due to 'macromutations', but rather an intermediate position between that and the ""only micromutations"" view of gradualistic neo-Darwinism. And, as just mentioned, mutations in developmental processes (even ones that resulted in 'macromutations' in the adult form) would have been more tolerated in the simpler animals that existed ~540 mya than they would be in today's.   Second, ~540 million years ago animal diversity was extremely more limited than it is today, so there was a huge number of open niches: a plentitude the likes of which has never again existed on our planet. An organism that happened to find itself in one of the multitude of open niches (by means of a ""semi-macro"" mutation, the product of a change in a developmental gene) would have faced little if any competition. The reduced external competition would potentially allow the morphological variation(s), that would otherwise likely have been eliminated, to persist. (The sudden change could leave the organism with a lower level of internal coordination: over time, internal coadaptation could evolve to 'catch up' with the change in morphology: these internal adjustments would leave no trace in the fossil record).   Combining these two ideas produces a reasonable explanation of the 'explosion' in new body plans in Vendian/Cambrian times."

fact_1305	fact	Ah, yes, a return to the redefinition of '(un)natural'. Fair enough - it's using the Bible to support a viewpoint, but that's kinda what creationism is I guess.  From the 'scientific' creationist view, the challenge would be to then prove that humans have never undergone 'micro'evolution. Especially given the various mutations and differences in humans today - from minor differences like height and hair colour to more major differences like minor variations in bone structure (often racial differences) to the most extreme differences like varying number of appendages (see the 'two-toed' tribes).  But you're right - I guess that the traditional response would be 'the bible says this, so reality must be wrong...'

fact_2383	fact	Well, I'm not sure the principles of physics and such would be any different - surely God could make them the way they are now and suspend them at will.  That said, it seems reasonable, from a biological/geological perspective, that the following observations would be made:  1. There would be a single mass extinction event for ALL flora and fauna, not numerous, asynchronous extinctions in differing environments encompassing particular groups of creatures  2. This mass extinction would coincide with a single, large, relatively uniform stratum of a more or less heterogeneous composition, or perhaps a very few strata still with the same basic property, not numerous discontinuous strata  3. there would be numerous complete fossils of all creatures living at the time, to include soft-bodied creatures (since rapid burial followed by fossilization is much more likely to preserve soft tissues either via imprints or actual fossilization)  4. the complete fossils should all be found in contemporaneous strata, i.e., human fossils should be found in the same layers as dinosaurs  5. The biological species concept should be very simple to define, as all living (and extinct) creatures would be, first of all, much less diverse, and each 'kind' would be simple to classify  6. there would be no reason to find, or even to expect to find, a unity of basic forms or functions or genomic content in extant creatures (e.g., no 'universal' genetic code, mammals with more or less than 4 limbs, etc.)  Well, that is a few off the top of my head...

fact_577	fact	Well, let's think about that for a moment. The earth's atmosphere has a mass estimated at 5x10^18 kg, and that's if we count all of it, right up to the troposphere. Three quarters of a billion cubic miles of water would have a mass of around 3x10^21kg, almost a thousand times greater.  So even if the heat from the emerging floodwaters was dissipated into the entire atmosphere, the water would only be cooled by about 0.1 degrees before atmospheric temperatures reached equilibrium and no more cooling could occur.

fact_2354	fact	"The militia of the Second Amendment is a militia that is described as being well regulated (regulated by both the federal government and the states as spoken of in Article 1 of the Constitution). In our own day, I think the National Guard would be the only militia that qualifies as being well regulated.   Alexander Hamilton spoke of the desirability of the militia being well regulated:  ""It requires no skill in the science of war to discern that uniformity in the organization and discipline of the militia would be attended with the most beneficial effects, whenever they were called into service for the public defense. It would enable them to discharge the duties of the camp and of the field with mutual intelligence and concert an advantage of peculiar moment in the operations of an army; and it would fit them much sooner to acquire the degree of proficiency in military functions which would be essential to their usefulness. This desirable uniformity can only be accomplished by confiding the regulation of the militia to the direction of the national authority. It is, therefore, with the most evident propriety, that the plan of the convention proposes to empower the Union ""to provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining the militia, and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the United States, RESERVING TO THE STATES RESPECTIVELY THE APPOINTMENT OF THE OFFICERS, AND THE AUTHORITY OF TRAINING THE MILITIA ACCORDING TO THE DISCIPLINE PRESCRIBED BY CONGRESS.""  The Federalist Papers - THOMAS (Library of Congress)  We could go back to the days when most citizens were required to enroll in the militia, have guns and get military training- to what the Founders really meant when they spoke of a well regulated militia being the security of a free state. But the Supreme Court along with pro-gun activists claiming to be pro- Second Amendment have decided to turn their back on that part of the Second Amendment while giving the lip service to the idea of a militia."

fact_1661	fact	"To step in for Duck,  Why would he follow a 74 year old with parkinson's if he weren't the pope? We wouldn't. The whole point is that he is the pope. We look to the pope to be the messenger of Christ and thus an authority on faith and morals. (By the way he's 84  years old and I think he gives a powerful message about the value of life and purpose in the elderly.) So we don't just follow any 74 year old with parkinson's. We follow the one who is the 264th successor of Peter who was appointed by Christ to lead his Church.  But to address your assertion on the bible and abortion:  Nowhere in the Bible is abortion specifically prohibited but the foundation of Christian argument from a biblical perspective is the fact that the unborn being is established as a person from the moment of creation. The unborn being is considered a child. Thus the commandment, ""Thou shalt not kill"" applies. Check out some of these verses as a start: Exodus 21:22-25, Psalm 139:13-16, Psalm 71:6, Deutoronomy 30:19, Luke 1:15 and 1:41, Isaiah 49:1, Jeremiah1:5, 1 Corinthians 6:19-20    It is also of note that it was, in a sense, a curse to be barren in the Jewish/Christian community. Children were thought of as a blessing from God Psalm 127:3-5, Matthew 18:10  (there are many other indications of this as well). An attempt at abortion would go against the prevailing culture and mindset.  The early Church also spoke out against abortion. Look at this link to see excerpts of the Church Fathers on the subject:   http://www.catholic.com/library/Abortion.asp    Keep in mind that not all Christian practices and beliefs are explicity spelled out in scripture.  In discussing abortion in the light of Christianity (including scripture), there are some essentials that must be noticed. The Bible unequivocally ""tells"" us that abortion is wrong and in stark contrast to the Christian message. It does that in the nativity of the Gospel of Luke and it does that in the Passion narratives of the four Gospels. The Christian story is about birth, creation, joy, and perseverance. It is also about sacrifice for others and giving life.   Father Frank Pavone illustrates this by describing a remarkable contrast in thought on abortion between abortion supporters and Christ.   Abortion supporters say, ""This is my body, I can do with it what I want. I can destroy others to preserve my life. I can destroy others so that I may live as I want. Do not interfere with me.""  Whereas, Christ says, ""This is my body, which is given up for you.""   ""This is my body""--same words but much different in intent, in action, in charity, in love, in faith, in hope...

fact_1107	fact	Actually, not at all true. The organisms of the Cambrian look little like modern animals. It is only the major phyla that are recognized by the derived characteristics. For example, the cordates first arise in the early Cambrian, along with primitive inverebrates. You can safely say that no animal living today looks much like any living then. For example, there were no amphibians, no reptiles, no insects, no birds, and of course, no mammals.  Your shotgun approach isn't actually worth answering in any detail. It isn't even your work.
fact_371	fact	Well for one thing, Darwin did not know about genetics. He knew there was a mechanism, but did not know what that mechanism could be. As for everything else, you are making what is known as a 'straw man', also assertions without evidence, and just plain bad logic.

fact_417	fact	"I know what you meant.  My comment was to demonstrate the counter side of the issue.  Interracial marriage laws were overturned at a time when this country disapproved of interracial marriage by a margin of three to one.  By your approach, interracial marriage laws SHOULD NOT have been overturned in the 1960's.  In fact, by your approach we still would have had illegal interracial marriage into the late 80's, early 90's.  The 14th amendment makes no proviso about allowing unjust discrimination in cases of majority rule.  By your approach, WHAT WOULD BE THE POINT?  If the majority disapproves of the discrimination, they simply ""vote"" it out of existence. No need for the courts at all."
fact_1932	fact	Surely the theory of evolution cannot predict whether a species is extinct or not!  I thought that crocodiles and alligators were in about the same state as they were millions of years ago and that was because thier habitat did not require them to change therefore the odd slight mutations that gain the advantage and lead to change was of no advantage.  If the coelacanth's habitat was no condusive to change then the same would apply.

fact_365	fact	Actually, the dating is done on layers above and below the rock in which fossils are found. You see, generally fossils are found in some sort of sedimentary rock. And sedimentary rock cannot be dated. But a layer of volcanic ash above and below the fossil can be dated and thus give a date within a range.
fact_359	fact	No, it doesn't. The big picture of evolution is that it is the observed change in the heritable characteristics in populations of organims over generations. In cases where populations become fragmented, the separate (reproductively isolated) segments of the population will accumulate genetic differences. The longer they are separated, the more likely it will be that they will be unable to interbreed if united. This is observed. The result is the establishment of separate species.
fact_2234	fact	I know this may seem obvious to most people, but it seems to have escaped the notice of creationists. Birds are tetrapods, as are amphibians, reptiles, and mammals. Birds didn't just grow wings. Wings are adaptions of the front limbs that were covered with feathers. Perhaps you are unaware of the evidence that indicates that maniraptors had feathers, probably for thermoregulation. Saying that there is no mechanism for birds to grow wings when they previously had none is like saying that there is no mechanism for mankind to grow arms when he previously had none. You see, mankind's closest relatives are the two species of chimpanzee - they are quadrupeds.

Are you accusing him of journalistic fraud? If this is true, you should be. You know, if agent William Newell did not actually say that, this author will be fired. William Newell himself will tell every other news outlet that he did not say that!   Are you, perhaps, a bit too zealous in standing up for your guy?   Maybe you will watch this carefully, and post the story if his firing, or at the very least, his retraction. Or perhaps William Newell's statement condemning this Journalistic Fraud, if that is what it is. Man would THAT help your credibility right now.

But the Court adds a new wrinkle to this test by transposing it from the legal considerations associated with the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to this case arising under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

fact_2208	fact	In a way, taking rights away is an American value since we have prescribed methods for doing it. For instance, we have legislatures which posess authority to remove a large number of what you likely consider to be rights. Here are just a small number that come to mind:  1) Right to murder  2) Right to own slaves  3) Right to rape  4) Right to abusing children  5) Right to vote  6) Right to smoke (if you're under 18)  7) Right to drink (18th Amendment)  8) Right to engage in certain activities in public  9) Right to drive as fast as one wants  10) Right to dump dangerous chemicals in the nearest river  The list goes on really. The fact is that you don't object to taking rights away in principle, you only object to taking away those rights that you wish to retain. That is quite inconsistent.  Where do you get the idea that one has a right to perform an abortion anyway?

For bats and whales and cave-dwelling birds echolocation confers huge advantage, allowing them to exploit niches closed to competing species.

You obviously have no clue into the idea of customer service- which is the field I work in. You try to do whatever is in the best interest of the customer, even if it sends them to your competition. IN the case of planned parenthood, it is against their policy to recommend that a patient do anything but dicuss it with their own support system, be that friends, family, clergy or whatever. Any employee of theirs who breaks that policy is making them liable for legal recourse, and will also be likely to lose their job.  I wonder, does your high school offer logic courses?

(not bragging, just providing some background) I started ""online"" debating even before the internet was available to the general public. We used a direct dial BBS called ""FIDONET."" (look it up on Wikipedia)  I used to be ""pro-choice"" with regard to elective abortion.  and the legality thereof. I was of the (seemingly very common) belief that many people express; ""I wouldn't personally want my child aborted,.. but who am I to tell a woman what she can and can not do with her body?""  Sound familiar?  Long story, short? My views started changing in 1989 when an up and coming radio talk show host issued a challenge. He (Rush Limbaugh) said that he believed that ""a persons life (rights) begins at and by their conceptionm,,, and he wanted someone to prove to him that it can possibly begin any other way.""  (I despised Rush Limbaugh)  That challenge began my education process on the many abortion aspects and issues... and I have been actively involved ever since.

fact_1271	fact	"**  The war against war metaphorsThe age-old practice may harm both science and scientists  [Published 16th February 2007 03:05 PM GMT]  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Last month, when the University of Nottingham in the UK opened its new Centre for Healthcare Associated Infections, a facility dedicated to studying and controlling ""superbugs,"" The Guardian newspaper interviewed its director, Richard James, about why such a research center was necessary. He said:   ""This is a sophisticated army with astonishing weapons. And each time we develop something new, [bacteria] develop a defense for it.""   The use of such war metaphors in science and medicine is not new. As early as 1934, the British Medical Journal wrote about the ""War Against Cancer,"" a phrase we still often hear. But today, militaristic language pops up in almost every scientific domain: conservation biology (""invasive species,"" ""biosecurity""); global warming (""global war on global warming""); and biomedicine (""killer cells,"" ""hitting multiple targets""). The attraction to such language is understandable, as it draws attention, and perhaps even funding (who can forget US President Richard Nixon's declaration to ""conquer"" cancer in his 1971 state of the union address, since which hundreds of billions of dollars have poured into cancer research?). Still, some scientists worry that the use of war metaphors has negative effects on both science and the scientists who adopt the language.   For instance, scientists who use military terms may risk losing credibility, warned Erik von Elm, an epidemiologist at the University of Berne in Switzerland and co-author of a recent Lancet correspondence on military metaphors. ""One of the features of science should be to be objective,"" but war metaphors are precisely the opposite, he noted. ""These terms have an intention, they are sort of modern propaganda."" Indeed, when Nottingham's James referred publicly to the coming ""post-antibiotic apocalypse,"" the UK's Chief Nursing Officer accused him of sensationalism and scaremongering.   Scientists who frame problems in a militaristic manner also likely have a drastically limited perception of the problem and how to tackle it, noted Berkeley cognitive linguist George Lakoff. ""This is not language, this is the way people think."" In microbiology, for instance, scientists often frame viruses and bacteria as the enemy, and may focus on destroying them and be blind to alternatives, said Brigitte Nerlich, professor of science, language and society at the University of Nottingham. With bacteria like methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), however, ""You have to look at multiple factors, and not just in terms of attack and defend,"" she said. Indeed, some argue that our militaristic use of antimicrobial agents has, by introducing new selection pressures, only made pathogens stronger, while a consideration of other factors -- like host behavior and the social and physical environment -- could offer better solutions.   Brendon Larson, assistant professor of environment and resources studies at the University of Waterloo in Canada, argued the same of ""invasion biology,"" where scientists may automatically assume an invading species must be removed. But in some cases, a sustainable relationship makes more sense -- for example, removal of the ""invading"" Himalayan blackberry from parts of California hurt the native tricolored blackbird, which used the plants as nesting habitats. ""We're entrenched in a particular way of seeing this situation, that [invasive species are] enemies, they're bad and we have to get rid of them,"" Larson told The Scientist. Indeed, according to Larson, the modern use of military terminology may have contributed to US President George W. Bush's decision to merge part of the government agency responsible for invasive species into the Department of Homeland Security.   Still, scientists are not likely to move beyond the adversarial metaphor anytime soon, said Columbia University's Barron Lerner, author of The Breast Cancer Wars: Hope, Fear and the Pursuit of a Cure in Twentieth-Century America. ""They're here to stay,"" Lerner said, admitting that when he was writing about the prevalence of such metaphors, he unknowingly began using them himself. Remembering, as writer Susan Sontag advised, that war metaphors in medicine can be misleading, and remaining aware of metaphors' effect on science, is the best scientists can do, Lerner noted.

Up until the turn of the 20th century marriage was about property. The man physically owned the woman and the children. I sometimes laugh at these cithgaps, espically the women, when they talk about defending the traditional marriage.

Although I did notice at the beginning the introduction stated that it's illegal for someone to fill out the paperwork for you, and that it's a federal felony. So once again I must ask, if they have this evidence on tape, why were no arrests made? Supposedly these are licensed investigators, fully authorized and everything.

fact_1071	fact	But Mexicans and Native Americans are the same species, so it's not just like that. This butterfly is a species different than either parent.  One reason that that particular creationist objection has no merit is because the butterflies are significantly biologically different (i.e. different species). The fact that we call each species a type of butterfly has only to do with our taxonomic system.  If we were to somehow have fossils representing the complete record of the water-to-land transition, one would be forced to pick a point at which a fish became a land animal. Just because one finds this a difficult task to accomplish doesn't mean that there was no transition. Likewise, this applies to any line of ancestry.  As an example, look at creationists' response to Archaeopteryx. Many insisted that it is a bird. Others insisted that it is a reptile. A few have originally called it a bird, then decided that it must be a reptile. The fact that people have trouble fitting an organism into our previously-learned concepts of classifications is a sign that species have changed significantly.

fact_373	fact	Yes you did, your very own god that fits what you wish to believe.  It is not the God of Abraham,Issac and Jacob.  He believed Moses was a real person and Genesis was history .  Mat 8:4 And Jesus saith unto him, See thou tell no man; but go thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.   Mat 17:3 And, behold, there appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking with him.   Mat 17:4 Then answered Peter, and said unto Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here: if thou wilt, let us make here three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias.   Mat 19:7 They say unto him, Why did Moses then command to give a writing of divorcement, and to put her away?   Mat 19:8 He saith unto them, Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives: but from the beginning it was not so.   Mat 22:24 Saying, Master, Moses said, If a man die, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.   Mat 23:2 Saying, The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat  Mar 1:44 And saith unto him, See thou say nothing to any man: but go thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing those things which Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.   Mar 7:10 For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, Whoso curseth father or mother, let him die the death:   Mar 9:4 And there appeared unto them Elias with Moses: and they were talking with Jesus.   Mar 9:5 And Peter answered and said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias.   Mar 10:2 And the Pharisees came to him, and asked him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife? tempting him.   Mar 10:3 And he answered and said unto them, What did Moses command you?   Mar 10:4 And they said, Moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement, and to put her away.   Mar 10:5 And Jesus answered and said unto them, For the hardness of your heart he wrote you this precept.   Mar 12:26 And as touching the dead, that they rise: have ye not read in the book of Moses, how in the bush God spake unto him, saying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?   Yes the God of the Bible did not see Moses as a mythical science fiction writer as you do.  Why do you consider yourself a Christian if you consider Jesus Christ a liar and a fool?  You may notice I have not used the Old Testement at all here. You have to dismiss the entire Bible out of hand to believe in evolution.  It is a conscious choice you make every day.

fact_401	fact	Could you be more specific?
fact_1930	fact	But here I slam into my own brick wall, one which neatly intersects my path down your chain of reasoning. Biological systems are simply orders of magnitude more complex than any other chemical processes because they are , by definition, autocatalytic-with-errors systems, which is a giant leap in terms of potential, in terms of the variety of future system-states that can be generated. But it is still possible to model these system-state trajectories in terms of probability, which is where chaos theory and emergence come in.  To bring myself to a close, I return to my original point. The concept 'emergence' is a human-imposed concept that can be easily described, if you so wish, as new information arising in a system ex nihilo. But it is equally easily (and more precisely) described as a rearrangent of a system's information in a way that is specifically unpredictable. That is what emergence is. There is no 'energy' created ex nihilo. There is no 'matter' created ex nihilo. The only thing that seems to be created ex nihilo is that sudden realisation within the human mind that the patterns of information have drastically changed in a way that redefines the entire system. This is why maths is essential, because the maths shows that the system has merely been reorganised, albeit radically.  It is such radical restructuring of information that I suspect gives rise to apparent consciousness. As I have said before, I do not deny consciousness, and I do prefer to think that it is real. But I do not assume that it is anything but apparent when I am making analytical judgements, and I cannot begin to imagine how you come to the conclusion that organisms such as bacteria possess it when they specifically, are quite obviously and evidently, no more than fiendishly complex micromachinery. With mammals it's another story.
fact_1677	fact	"Just a layperson of course. But I'll give it a stab.  ... For besides the point that vitalism is an untestable hypothesis and thus useless in looking at these questions...   How does such reasoning prove anything of the sort. All you have is the fact that humans understand the reasons for some variations and not for others. Besides, a selected variation does not mean that it will bode for the best. That is WW's interpretation and value judgment ... in hindsight ... a variation of the view .. twas God's will, He knew what he was doing ... but all you have definitively established is that you yourself looked to the past and infered intent as to the future based on your selective perceptions about what was going on and what feels good. Time and space are muddled. Seems to me that the observer using the more effective scientific method sticks (well) religiously to the present moment.  Plus, ""acausal"" doesnât really mean ""no cause,"" does it? Just that we havenât determined one. It looks to me like the agnostic view. We don't know what's going on.  Random also seems to mean that there are unknown variables or conditions present.  Reminds me of discussion re abiogenesis and the term ""spontaneous."" I think us laypeople at least mistakenly look at causation in a very linear fashion. Rather than in terms of a set of conditions giving rise to other phenomenon.  An aside.

Anyway, it seems that you are celebrating prematurely at this point since Congress must approve this move before it's a done deal.  DC City Council votes to legalize gay marriage  (AP) â 4 hours ago  WASHINGTON â Washington D.C.'s City Council has voted to legalize gay marriage in the nation's capital.  Mayor Adrian Fenty has promised to sign the bill, which was co-sponsored by 10 of the council's 13 members. The final vote Tuesday was 11-2.  The bill now goes to Congress, which has final say over the district's laws. Opponents say they'll try to get Congress or voters to overturn it.  Passage of the bill is a victory for gay marriage supporters, who have been dealt a recent string of defeats in Maine, New York and New Jersey.  Gay marriage is legal in Massachusetts, Connecticut, Iowa and Vermont. New Hampshire will begin issuing licenses in January.  If Congress doesn't reject the bill, D.C. should start issuing marriage licenses around St. Patrick's Day.  The Associated Press: DC City Council votes to legalize gay marriage

fact_84	fact	Oh, well I'm not saying that companies won't be paying more money in health insurance. My point is that allowing same-sex marriage doesn't really change company policy. The company's policy is currently based on the government's definition of marriage. If the government simply allows more people to choose to classify themselves as married, the company may see more more married couples apply for jobs, and it may see more of its employees decide to become married. As it sees these things happening, it can feel free to change its policies as it sees fit. What I mean is that this ruling would not mandate the businesses to make any payments to facillitate a change; all that would happen is a few more of its employees might begin to classify themselves as married and it might be a bit more likely that the company hires in a married person. There is no mandate sent out to the company, there is no change in company policy, and there is no payment that the company is dishing out. If as more married people show up in the workplace, the company decides to change its health care coverage, that is up to the company, but it is not mandated to make any change.  Now maybe you can still classify this as an unfunded mandate, but I'm not really so sure that it legally qualifies under the circumstances. Regardless, I've been saying that its status as an unfunded mandate is irrelevant in determining whether it is right to agree with same-sex marriage or not; the fact that companies might have to provide all couples with health care equally instead of only giving health care to couples based on the sex of those involved is a change worth making. Quite a few companies already do it, in fact.

fact_1475	fact	"I think that while may be correct, it sounds too elitist to be accurate. Sane people don't create imaginary friends to explain things. Most tribal religions are very matter of fact. While exotic or fantastic they are very material (lots of talking animals), and also meant to be entertaining. They also incorporate superstitions, which often hold a few survival tips.  Also ""primitive"" religions revolve around hallucinations, via shamanism and drug use. I think no body asked why; they just got stoned and after they sobered up the human intellect kicks in an tries to reason if what happened was real then it must be some link to the supernatural. I know Judeo-Christian religions are anti drug use in most places, but in ancient times drugs was a very integral part of religion.  I have a soft spot in my heart for that ""Jesus Raved"" T-shirt."

fact_2140	fact	(My evidence does not require this quote, it's for comparison only)  The theory of evolution is based on evidence, the existence of god, is not..  Reason cannot be applied to it. Furthermore, since evolution relies on reason, faith cannot be applied to it. To attempt to label science as a faith is a contradiction. I know it irks you that your faith cannot be proven, but that's the definition of faith!! It wouldn't be faith without it. As Montalban says in a contradiction of motives: His particular faith does not rest on the foundations of [reason]. Why then look for support from reason?

fact_1449	fact	This is a good site to look at for such answers.       Tree of Life Web Project      By the way, 'and finally to a man' implies both a direction to evolution and an end point. Both of these are not part of the modern synthesis.
fact_2154	fact	"Actually, all evolutionists must have faith for their theory to be true. Can you prove that the big bang happened 15 billion years ago? No, all the evidence that we have in favour is the red shift of starlight and the background microwave radiation (which is all at the same temperature, give or take a few K). We all know how evolutionists interpret the evidence, but the evidence makes just as much more sense when interpreted through Dr Humphreys' new young earth relativistic cosmology model. This is outlined in his book ""Starlight and Time"" and is an amazing read. So the same evidence (e.g. redshift, CBM radiation) makes sense in both models (although CBM causes a little trouble in the big bang theory).   But we have no human eye witness accounts of the big bang or even creation unfolding. Nor we can observe life coming from lifeless chemicals, nor we can observe life going from simple to complex - today we observe mutations and natural selection going in the opposite direction. Basically, no one was there to see the supposed evolution of all things. We have no eye witness accounts of any of these events, they certainly cannot be repeated or experimented upon today.

fact_987	fact	In point of fact, the low birth rate in most of Europe is not due to the availablity of abortion, but to good sex education and the ready availablity of effective contraception to everyone who needs it. See this study, for instance:   http://www.advocatesforyouth.org/PUB...heet/fsest.htm  People have small families because they want small families. In point of fact, the abortion rate in Europe is generally much lower than the rate in the US, due, again, to education and contraception.   Would you force folks to have children they don't want?

fact_762	fact	Well, there is now string theory, which has grown into M-theory, which may have a rational answer (at least a mathematical one). But calling it a theory is really a misnomer. It's more like a hypothetical model.
fact_992	fact	Because evolution is a scientific theory, and has evidence for it. Creationism is religion. ID is bad science, and bad theology.. and there is no evidence for. If you look at the people who push it, and the place where their funding is coming from, you can see it is a religious front for far right CHristians.   Many Chrisitans do not have a problem with evolution. They are what are known as 'theistic Evolutionists', who feel that God directs the course of evolution. The intelligent ones of those realise that is a religious belief, not something that can be proven, hence it is an object of faith.   Evolution can be demonstrated in the lab. It makes predictions that can be tested. And, with 150 years of testing, it has not been able to be falsified.

Just like all the other hominid fossils.  Are you starting to see my point yet? You're trying to claim that because Lucy isn't conclusive proof, she means nothing. That's fallacious reasoning: Lucy contributes to the accumulated evidence supporting common descent.   I don't find Lucy's bones, in isolation, to be convincing evidence of common chimp/human ancestry. Even their discovery in just the right stratum isn't on its own completely convincing - it could be a fluke. But how many such flukes can one plausibly hypothesise? All the hundreds of other Australopithecus afarensis fossils dug up, for instance - surely some of them ought to have been found in anomalous strata if they had really coexisted with all other species from the beginning.
fact_979	fact	"You have to be logical and realistic in your expectations of what can demonstrated/observed as evolution in action and what can only be described from evidence from the distant past.  We can see the evolution of organisms in the world today, but because of the reproductive timeframe of many creatures we would not expect to see signifcant evolution take place in their populations over the last couple of hundred years. Take something that reproduces fast enough and great changes can be seen- look at the HIV virus and the myriad separate strains that have developed from a common ancestor in just a few decades of observation.  Ancient life can never be observed in its living state- all we have are the remains of these creatures in the form of fossils. As we can position these remains in time using stratigraphy and radiometric dating we can see what their relative temporal positions were. By comparing similar forms we can see how a descendant differs from its ancestor so we can determine how the structure of that line changed with time. So we see what has changed and when but we cannot see the exact ""how"", in the ancient instance at least (this is where the study of the modern gives insight)."

Whatever the explanation for the origins of the code, whether intentional agency, only RV+NS, self-organization or a combination of these, the fact that these processes converged on a single, reasonably optimal code that is able to facilitate evolution makes it look like it was an inevitable result from the system. The system seems to be rigged and biased towards certain outcomes similar to the evolution of life.

I worked in fraud prevention for 5 years. They ran a background check on me to make sure I wasn't a fraudster. It isn't the law, its just a smart thing to do. There wouldn't be any forms or anything even indicating why you are running their background. You just run an SSN and instantly find out if you can legally sell them a weapon. Again, this isn't something I believe should be law. The law is clear: it is a felony to sell a firearm to a convicted felon.

fact_560	fact	Well, yes. Eleven years is quite swift, but it actually supports the theory of evolution through natural selection. The estimates of the speed of evolution that you seem to be depending on were done by George Gaylord Simpson way back in the 1940s or 1950s. Since then, we have observed fruit flies, as well as other specimens, to evolve quite rapidly, showing significant evolution in only a decade or so. More recently, however, scientists have been able to observe evolution in natural settings and have found that it can sometimes be quite rapid when environmental change is rapid. Besides the studies that Reznick did on guppies, there are also the studies of the Galapagos finches by the grants, and studies of anole lizards in the Bahamas. These are observable phenotypical changes, not speciation events.

fact_206	fact	Just a technical point. Evolutionary theory does not require that mutations should be random. Molecular geneticists are well aware that some genes in some organisms mutate more often than others; alternatively, some genes are conserved more strongly than others. It's just that hotspots apart, there is no evidence for result-orientated directed mutation of genes. Within certain constraints, they appear to be random, but evolutionary theory as such doesn't demand that they should be.  Second, natural selection through competition for resources isn't the only force constraining evolution (though it is the major explanation of adaptation). There is also genetic drift which can distribute neutral mutations through populations, and there are probably also other factors such as structural constraints and canalisation affecting which mutations can see the light of day (i.e. get exposed to natural selection) and which will not.

fact_1104	fact	Aside from this being completly wrong, it is quite compelling. You make a good point in regard to an organism's form only making sense in relation to its environment. Of course, this is a cornerstone of evolutionary theory. Organisms that are more successful in a certain environment will reproduce and be the ones present in said environment. It actually is possible to look at genes without the context of the orginal creature. This is why we can move genes from one organism and place them in another. Given a complete understanding of molecular biology, we could contruct any form of organism we desired from scratch.

Of course there are valid reasons why Christ armed His men.  Romans 13: 1 Let every soul be subject to higher authorities, for there is no authority except from God, but the existing authorities have been ordained by God. 2 So that the one resisting authority has opposed the ordinance of God, and the ones opposing will receive judgment to themselves. 3 For the rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the bad. And do you desire not to fear the authority? Do the good, and you will have praise from it; 4 for it is a servant of God to you for the good. But if you practice evil, be afraid; for he does not bear the sword in vain; for he is a servant of God, an avenger for wrath to the one practicing evil. 5 Because of this, it is necessary to be subject, not only on account of wrath, but also on account of conscience. 6 For on this account you also pay taxes, for they are ministers of God, always giving attention to this very thing. 7 Then give to all their dues: to the one due tax, the tax; to the one due tribute, the tribute; to the one due fear, the fear; to the one due honor, the honor.

And here's a scholarly article from the biblical perspective that points out the different interpretations Theologians consider, both conservative and liberal.  http://www.grisda.org/origins/22058.htm  BIBLICAL EVIDENCE FOR THE  UNIVERSALITY OF THE GENESIS FLOOD  Richard M. Davidson  John Nevin Andrews Professor of Old Testament Interpretation  Old Testament Department  Andrews University, Berrien Springs, Michigan  Origins 22(2):58-73 (1995).   WHAT THIS ARTICLE IS ABOUT  The extent of the Genesis Flood has been vigorously debated by biblical scholars. For those who accept a recent creation week of six literal consecutive, twenty-four-days, a universal Flood is necessary to explain the existence of the geologic column. The thesis of this study is that only the traditional interpretation which posits a literal, universal, world-wide Genesis Flood does full justice to all the relevant biblical data. The author summarizes twenty-two lines of biblical evidence â including terminological, thematic, contextual, grammatical-syntactical, literary-structural, logical-conceptual, theological, canonical, and typological which support the universality of the Genesis Flood.  PLEASE NOTE: Unfortunately, we are unable to reproduce all of the special accent marks that were present in our printed version of the Hebrew transliteration. Our apologies for any inconvenience this might cause.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  I. Conflicting Schools of Interpretation  One of the most controversial aspects of the Flood narrative concerns the extent of the Genesis Flood. Three major positions are taken: (1) the traditional, which asserts the universal, world-wide, nature of the Deluge; (2) limited or local flood theories, which narrow the scope of the Flood story to a particular geographical location in Mesopotamia; and (3) non-literal (symbolic) interpretation, which suggests that the Flood story is a non-historical account written to teach theological truth.  Against this third position, the non-historical, we must note the evidences within the biblical account affirming the historical nature of the Flood. In the literary structure of the Flood story (see Shea 1979), the genealogical frame or envelope construction (Genesis 5:32 and 9:28-29) plus the secondary genealogies (Genesis 6:9-10 and 9:18-19) are indicators that the account is intended to be factual history. The use of the genealogical term tÃ´ledÃ´t (""generations,"" ""account"") in the Flood story (6:9) as throughout Genesis (13 times, structuring the whole book), indicates that the author intended this story to be as historically veracious as the rest of Genesis (Doukhan 1978, p 167-220). Walter Kaiser analyzes the literary form of Genesis 1-11 and concludes that this whole section of Genesis must be taken as ""historical narrative prose"" (Kaiser 1970).  A number of references in the book of Job may allude to the then-relatively-recent Flood (Job 9:5-8; 12:14-15; 14:11-12; 22:15-17; 26:10-14; 28:9; 38:8-11; see Morris 1988, p 26-30). The historical occurrence of the Flood is part of the saving/judging acts of God, and its historicity is assumed and essential to the theological arguments of later biblical writers employing Flood typology (see Davidson 1981, p 326-327); more on this point later.  Thus according to the biblical writers, far from being a non-historical, symbolical, or mythical account written only to teach theological truths, the Flood narrative is intended to accurately record a real, literal, historical event.  For evangelical Christians who take seriously the biblical record and accept the historicity of the Flood account, the question still remains whether the event described is to be taken as a local, limited flood or a universal, world-wide cataclysm.  The limited flood theories rest primarily on scientific arguments that present seemingly difficult geological, biological, and anthropological problems for a universal flood. (See Boardman 1990, p 212-223; Custance 1979, p 28-58; Kidner 1967, p 93-95; Mitchell 1982/1993; Ramm 1954, p 232-249; Young 1977, p 171-210). Since the scientific argumentation is not the subject of this article, I can only suggest that these problems are not insurmountable, although much more study is needed. A number of studies provides a growing body of evidence for diluvial catastrophism as an alternative to conventional long-age geology (see Coffin and Brown 1983; Roth 1985, 1986a, 1988; Whitcomb 1988; Baumgardner 1994a,b).  The local flood theories further assert that the terminology describing the extent of the Flood should be interpreted in a relative and not absolute universal sense. The various seemingly universal terms are regarded as implying only a limited locality; they are seen to indicate universality within the writer's world-view but a limited scope in terms of our modern world view. (See Boardman 1990, p 223-226; Custance 1979, p 15-27; Kidner 1967, p 93-95; Ramm 1954, p 241-242.) We will take up this issue in the next section of this article.  The traditional conservative understanding of the Flood narrative is that Genesis 6-9 describes a universal, world-wide Deluge. It should be noted that this is also the view of the majority of liberal-critical commentators on Genesis 6-9, although they regard the biblical view as borrowed from the ANE accounts and not historical. (See Hasel 1975, p 78 and Note 16 for bibliography of representatives of this position: Fohrer, Koehler, Noth, Procksch, Skinner, Sarna, Speiser, von Rad, Vriezen, Zimmerli, etc. Some of these and other more recent representatives of this view are cited later in this article.)  The thesis of this article is that only the traditional position of a literal, universal world-wide Flood does full justice to the biblical data, and this universal interpretation is crucial for Flood theology in Genesis and for the theological implications drawn by later biblical writers.  II. Biblical Terminology in Genesis 6-9 Indicating Universality  Perhaps the most important kind of biblical evidence for a universal Flood is the specific all-inclusive terminology found within the Genesis account itself. The late Gerhard Hasel has provided a careful treatment of this terminology in three penetrating studies in previous issues of Origins (Hasel 1974, 1975, 1978), and therefore I need not go into detail in this article. Eight different terms or phrases in Genesis 6-9, most echoing their counterparts in the world-wide creation account of Genesis 1-2, indicate universality.  First, the term haÃares ""the earth,"" occurring 46 times in the Flood narrative (Genesis 6:12, 13, 17, etc.), always without any accompanying genitive of limitation, clearly parallels the usage of the same term in the account of world-wide, universal creation in Genesis 1:1, 2, 10. (While the term at times elsewhere may be used without a genitive and still in context be limited in scope to a certain ""land,"" the explicit link to creation in the Flood account (see especially Genesis 6:6, 7) clearly gives a universal context for its usage in Genesis 6-9.)  Some have argued that if Moses had wished to indicate the entire world, he would have used the Hebrew term tebel, which means the world as a whole, or dry land in the sense of continents. This word is never used in the Flood narrative. But it should be pointed out that tebel is never used in the entire Pentateuch, including the creation account. In fact, the term appears no where in the narrative portions of the Hebrew Bible, but only in poetic texts (39 times) usually as a poetic synonym in parallel with haÃares ""the earth."" Thus this argument from silence does not adequately consider the contextual and poetic use of terminology, and carries little weight.  A second expression, ""upon the face of all the earth"" Ãal-penÃª kol-haÃares (Genesis 7:3; 8:9), clearly alludes to the first occurrence of the same phrase in the universal context of creation (Genesis 1:29; cf. Genesis 1:2 for a related universal expression), and thus here also implies a universality of the same dimension, i.e., the entire surface of the global mass. While the shortened term ""all the earth"" (kol-haÃares) by itself may have a limited meaning elsewhere when indicated by the immediate context (see Exodus 10:5, 15; Numbers 22:5, 11; 1 Kings 4:34; 10:24; 2 Chronicles 36:23; Genesis 41:57), the immediate context of the Flood story is the universal sinfulness of humankind whom God had made and created (Genesis 6:6,7) to have dominion over ""all the earth"" (Genesis 1:26), and the succeeding context is the universal dispersal of man after the Tower of Babel ""upon the face of all the earth"" (Genesis 11:4, 8, 9). In each of the four occurrences of the phrase ""upon the face of all the earth"" in Genesis outside the Flood story (Genesis 1:29; 11:4, 8, 9), it clearly has the universal sense of the entire land surface of the globe, and there is nothing in the Flood narrative to indicate any less universality. (It should be also noted that the one place in Genesis where in context a similar phrase ""upon all the face of the earth"" is not universal [the famine mentioned in Genesis 41:56], the Hebrew has a change in word order from elsewhere in Genesis [Ãal-kol penÃª haÃares]).  Third, the phrase ""face of the ground"" penÃª haÃadamah (five times in the Flood narrative, 7:4, 22, 23; 8:8, 13), occurs in parallel with universal terms we have just noted, ""the earth"" (7:23) and ""face of all the earth"" (8:9); and this phrase ""face of the ground"" likewise harks back to its first usage in the universal context of creation (Genesis 2:6).  Fourth, the term kol-basar ""all flesh"" occurs 12 times in Genesis 6-9 (Genesis 6:12, 13, 17, 19; 7:16, 21; 8:17; 9:11, 15, 16, 17). The word kol ""all"" (which can occasionally express less than totality if the context demands), before an indeterminate noun with no article or possessive suffix, as here in Genesis 6-9, indicates totality. God's announcement to destroy ""all flesh"" (Genesis 6:13, 17) and the narrator's comment that ""all flesh"" died (Genesis 7:21-22), except the inhabitants of the ark, indicates universal destruction. The one occurrence of kol plus the determinate noun ha basar ""all the flesh"" (in Genesis 7:15) likewise indicates totality as well as unity.  Fifth, the expression ""every living thing"" (kol-hahay) of all flesh (Genesis 6:19), is another expression of totality; in 7:4, 23, the similar term kol-hayeqÃ»m means literally, ""all existence."" This term is given further universal dimensions by the addition of the clause harking back to creation â ""all existence that I have made"" (7:4) â and by the exclusive statement ""Only Noah and those who were with him in the ark remained alive"" (7:23). As Hasel puts it:  There is hardly any stronger way in Hebrew to emphasize total destruction of 'all existence' of human and animal life on earth than the way it has been expressed. The writer of the Genesis Flood story employed terminology, formulae, and syntactical structures of the type that could not be more emphatic and explicit in expressing his concept of a universal, world-wide flood (Hasel 1975, p 86).  Sixth, the phrase ""under the whole heaven"" (tahat kol-haÅ¡Å¡amayim, Genesis 7:19), is used six times in the OT outside of the Flood narrative, and always with a universal meaning (see Deuteronomy 2:25; 4:19; Job 28:24; 37:3; 41:11; Daniel 9:12). For example, the phrase is used to describe God's omniscience: ""For He looks to the ends of the earth and sees under the whole heavens"" (Job 28:24). Again, it depicts God's sovereignty: ""Whatsoever is under the whole heaven is mine"" (Job 41:11 KJV). (Note that the usage in Deuteronomy 2:25, describing ""the nations under the whole heaven,"" is further qualified and limited by the phrase ""who shall hear the report of you,"" and thus is potentially universal and not an exception to the universal sense.)  The universal phrase ""under the whole heaven"" or ""under all the heavens"" also universalizes the phrase ""under heaven"" (Genesis 6:17) in this same Flood context. The word ""heaven"" alone can have a local meaning [e.g., 1 Kings 18:45], but here the context is clearly universal. Ecclesiastes, which contains numerous allusions to creation, likewise utilizes the term ""under heaven"" with a universal intention (Ecclesiastes 1:13; 2:3; 3:1; cf. the parallel universal expression ""under the sun"" in Ecclesiastes 1:3, 9; 2:11, 17; etc.).  In the Flood account this phrase ""under the whole heaven"" is part of two forceful verses describing the extent of the Flood: ""and the waters prevailed so mightily upon the earth that all the high mountains under the whole heaven were covered. The waters prevailed fifteen cubits upward, and the mountains were covered"" (7:19, 20). Critical scholar John Skinner notes that 7:19, 20 ""not only asserts its [the flood's] universality, but so to speak proves it, by giving the exact height of the waters above the highest mountains"" (Skinner 1930/1956, p 165).  The biblical language here simply cannot be explained in terms of a local sky, and certainly cannot refer to the local mountains being covered by snow, as some proponents of a local flood suggest. H.C. Leupold points out that the writer of vs. 19 is not content with a single use of kol (""all"") in ""all the high mountains,"" but ""since 'all' is known to be used in a relative sense, the writer removes all possible ambiguity by adding the phrase 'under all the heavens.' A double 'all' (kol) cannot allow for so relative a sense. It almost constitutes a Hebrew superlative. So we believe that the text disposes of the question of the universality of the Flood"" (Leupold 1942, p 301-302).  Seventh, Hasel devoted an entire scholarly article to the phrase ""all the fountains [maÃyenoth] of the Great Deep [tehÃ´m rabbah]"" (Genesis 7:11; 8:2), and showed how it is linked with the universal ""Deep"" (tehÃ´m) or world-ocean in Genesis 1:2 (cf. Psalm 104:6: ""Thou didst cover it [the earth] with deep [tehÃ´m] as with a garment; the waters were standing above the mountains""). The ""breaking up"" and ""bursting forth"" (i.e., geological faulting) of not just one subterranean water spring in Mesopotamia, but of all the ""fountains"" of the Great Deep, coupled in the same verse with the opening of the windows of the heavens, far transcends a local scene. Hasel perceptively concludes that ""the bursting forth of the waters from the fountains of the 'great deep' refers to the splitting open of springs of subterranean waters with such might and force that together with the torrential downpouring of waters stored in the atmospheric heavens a worldwide flood comes about"" (Hasel 1974, p 71).  Eighth, in another article, Hasel (1978) shows how the Hebrew Bible reserved a special term mabbÃ»l which in its 13 occurrences refers exclusively to the universal Genesis Flood (12 occurrences in Genesis, once in Psalm 29: 10). This word may be derived from the Hebrew root ybl ""to flow, to stream."" The term mabbÃ»l, which in the Flood narrative is usually associated with mayim ""waters,"" seems to have become ""a technical term for waters flowing or streaming forth and as such designates the flood (deluge) being caused by waters. ... mabbÃ»l is in the Old Testament a term consistently employed for the flood (deluge) which was caused by torrential rains and the bursting forth of subterranean waters"" (Hasel 1978, p 92-93). This technical term clearly sets the Genesis Deluge apart from all local floods, and is utilized in the Psalm 29:10 to illustrate Yahweh's universal sovereignty over the world at the time of the Noahic Flood: ""The Lord sat enthroned at the Flood, and the Lord sits as King forever.""  Summarizing regarding the technical terminology used for the extent of the Flood in Genesis 6-9, Hasel writes:   The Genesis flood narrative provides ample evidence of being an account which is to be understood as a historical narrative in prose style. It expects to be taken literally. There is a consistent and overwhelming amount of terminology and formulae ... which on the basis of context and syntax has uniformly indicated that the flood story wants to be understood in a universal sense: the waters destroyed all human and animal plus bird life on the entire land mass of the globe. To read it otherwise means to force a meaning on the carefully written and specific syntactical constructions of the original language which the text itself rejects (Hasel 1975, p 87).  III. Other Biblical Evidence for a Universal Flood  Many additional lines of biblical evidence converge in affirming the universal extent of the Flood and also reveal the theological significance of this conclusion. We will summarize fourteen points that emerge from the biblical text.  First, the trajectory of major themes in Genesis 1-11 â Creation, Fall, plan of redemption, spread of sin â is universal in scope and calls for a corresponding universal judgment. We have already noted in reference to specific Flood terminology the numerous allusions to the universal context of creation. The creation of ""the heavens and the earth"" certainly is not local in scope according to Genesis 1-2.  Likewise, the Fall of humanity in Adam and Eve led to the sinful condition of the entire human race (haÃdam), not just the inhabitants of Mesopotamia (see Genesis 6:5, 11; Romans 3:19; 5:12). Again, the Protoevangelium (first Gospel promise) outlined in Genesis 3:15, involves the universal moral struggle between the spiritual descendants (or ""seed"") of the serpent and the spiritual descendants (""seed"") of the woman, culminating in the victory of the representative Messianic Seed over the serpent (see Robertson 1980). This plan of redemption is certainly universal in scope.  In a similar way, the sinful condition of humankind described at the time of the Flood includes more than those living in the Fertile Crescent. From God's perspective, not simply from the culturally conditioned local view of the narrator, we have the results of the divine investigative judgment: ""And God saw that the wickedness of man (haÃdam, humankind) was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually"" (Genesis 6:5). Such universal sinfulness naturally calls for universal judgment.  Second, the divine purpose given for the bringing of the Flood makes explicit its universal scope: ""And the Lord said, 'I will destroy man [(haÃdam), humanity] whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, creeping things and birds of the air, for I am sorry that I have made them"" (Genesis 6:7). Nothing less than a complete destruction of the human race (except for Noah, 6:8) seems envisaged. Given the length of time from creation (over 1650 years minimum), the longevity of the antediluvians (nearly a thousand years), and God's command at creation to ""fill the earth"" (Genesis 1:28), it is highly unlikely that the pre-Flood population would have stayed only in Mesopotamia. Thus the destruction of humanity would necessitate more than a local Flood.  Third, the genealogical lines from both Adam (Genesis 4:17-26; 5:1-31) and Noah (Genesis 10:1-32; 11:1-9) are exclusive in nature, indicating that as Adam was father of all pre-Flood humanity, so Noah was father of all post-Flood humanity. From the descendants of Noah ""the nations spread abroad on the earth after the flood"" (Genesis 10: 32), and the Tower of Babel experience spreads humanity across the globe (Genesis 11:1-19).  Striking extra-biblical evidence that all human races, and not just the nations of the Fertile Crescent, are included in the descendants of Noah, and retain memory of the universal Flood, is found in the amazing prevalence of ancient flood stories throughout the world. Over 230 different flood stories are known and occur among the most diverse peoples of the earth (see Frazer 1918, 1:105-361; Nelson 1931). A world-wide flood is by far the most frequently-given cause for past universally destructive calamities in the folk literature of antiquity (Thompson 1955, 1:182-194).  A remarkable number of these oral and written traditions agree upon the basic points of the biblical account: all humankind was destroyed by a great flood as a result of divine judgment against human sin, and a single man and his family or a few friends survived the deluge in a ship or other sea-faring vessel. The stories nearest to the area of the Dispersion at Babel are the closest in detail to the biblical account (see Heidel 1946, Jacobsen 1981, and Lambert and Millard 1969). This vast body of ancient witnesses to a world-wide Deluge is powerful testimony to the historicity and universality of the biblical Flood.  Fourth, the same inclusive divine blessing to be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth is given to both Adam and Noah (Genesis 1:28; 9:1). This is another linkage between universal creation and the flood, between the original beginning and the ""new beginning."" As the human race at creation flows from Adam and Eve, so the postdiluvial humanity is populated through Noah.  Fifth, the covenant (Genesis 9:9-10) with its rainbow sign (Genesis 9:12-17) is clearly linked to the extent of the Flood, and includes the whole earth (Genesis 9:13-17). If there was only a local flood, then the covenant would be only a limited covenant, and the rainbow sign of ""the all-embracing universality of the Divine mercy"" (Delitzsch 1888/1976, 1:289-290) would be stripped of its meaning.  Sixth, the viability of God's promise (Genesis 9:15; cf. Isaiah 54:9) and the integrity of God in keeping His promise is wrapped up in the world-wide extent of the Flood. This point cannot be underscored too heavily: if Genesis 6-9 describes only a local flood, then God has broken His promise every time another local flood has happened! The only way God's promise not to send another flood to destroy every living thing (Genesis 8:21) can be seen to have been kept is if the Flood was a universal one and the whole human race outside the ark was destroyed.  Seventh, the universality of the Flood is underscored by the enormous size of the ark detailed in Genesis 6:14-15 and the stated necessity for saving all the kinds of animals and plants in the ark (Genesis 6:16-21; 7:2-3). A massive ark filled with representatives of all non-aquatic animal/plant kinds would be unnecessary if this were only a local flood, for these kinds could have been preserved elsewhere in the world. Yet the divine insistence in the biblical record is that the animals were brought into the ark to preserve representatives of all of the various kinds (Genesis 6:19-20).  As a matter of fact, if only a local flood were in view, the building of any ark at all, even for Noah and his family, would have been superfluous â God could simply have warned Noah and his family in time to escape from the coming judgment, just as he did with Lot in Sodom. But the point of the narrative concerning the ark is that there was no other escape; in the midst of the Flood ""only Noah and those who were with him in the ark remained"" (Genesis 7:23).  Eighth, the covering of ""all the high mountains"" by at least 15 cubits (Genesis 7:19-20) could not involve simply a local flood, since water seeks its own level across the surface of the globe. Even one high mountain covered in a local Mesopotamian setting would require that same height of water everywhere on the planet's surface.  In this connection we note that it is not necessary to postulate the existence of mountains as high as Mt. Everest at the time of the Flood, and thus to require waters covering the earth to a depth of six miles, as some proponents of a local flood suggest would be necessary (see Ramm 1954, p 242). The antediluvian mountains were very possibly much lower than at present. Passages in the book of Job and Psalms may well be referring to the process of postdiluvian mountain uplift (see Job 9:5; 28:9; and Psalm 104:7-8).  Also in this connection we may address the objection that proponents of a local flood often raise, namely, that a world-wide Flood would imply ""that the earth's surface was completely renovated during the flood year"" and thus ""prediluvian topography would have been exceedingly different from postdiluvian topography."" This implication, they claim, is in conflict with biblical evidence which ""strongly suggests that prediluvian geography did basically resemble postdiluvian geography"" (Young 1977, p 210). Reference is made particularly to the topographical descriptions in connection with the Garden of Eden: the lands of Havilah and Cush, and the four rivers, two of which (the Tigris and the Euphrates) were familiar to the readers of Genesis in Moses' time.  What is not recognized in these arguments, however, is that although there are some similarities between the prediluvian and postdiluvian topography, there are more differences than similarities. Two of the rivers mentioned apparently no longer existed in Moses' time: the Pishon and Gihon are mentioned in terms of where they used to flow, in the postdiluvian areas of Havilah and Cush respectively. The other two rivers â the Tigris and Euphrates â are described as coming from a common source in the Garden of Eden, certainly far different from their present courses. Thus the topographical descriptions in the early chapters of Genesis are in harmony with a world-wide Flood. Also, it is likely that survivors of the Flood would use familiar names for topographical features after the Flood, even though the earth's surface looked entirely different.  Ninth, the duration of the Flood makes sense only with a universal flood. The Deluge of rain from above and water from the fountains of the deep below continued 40 days (Genesis 7:17), and all the highest mountains were still covered five months after the Flood began; the tops of the mountains were not seen until after seven months, and the Flood waters were not dried up enough for Noah to leave the ark until one year and ten days had passed (see Genesis 7:11; 8:14). Such lengths of time seem commensurate only with a universal and not a local flood.  Tenth, the receding activity of the water (Genesis 8:3a, 54a) is described by Hebrew phrases which, in parallel with similar phraseology and grammatical construction for the ""to and fro"" motion of the raven (Genesis 8:7), should be translated as ""going and retreating,"" (see Austin 1990, p 218; Hasel 1978, p 93) and imply oscillatory water motion lasting for 74 days (see Genesis 8:3-5). The waters rushing back and forth like in ocean tidal movement as the overall level gradually decreased, supports a universal interpretation such as ""the oceanic energy impulse model of the flood"" (Austin 1990, p 218), but is incongruous with a local flood theory.  Eleventh, the NT passages concerning the Flood all employ universal language: ""swept them all away"" (Matthew 24:39); ""destroyed them all,"" (Luke 17:27); ""he did not spare the ancient world, but preserved Noah with seven other persons, ... when he brought a flood upon the world of the ungodly"" (2 Peter 2:5); ""a few, that is eight persons, were saved through water"" (1 Peter 3:20); Noah ""condemned the world"" (Hebrews 11:7). A local flood would not have ended the antediluvian world. As Archer states, ""we have the unequivocal corroboration of the New Testament that the destruction of the human race at the time of the flood was total and universal"" (Archer 1985, p 208).  Twelfth, the NT Flood typology assumes and depends upon not only the historicity, but also the universality, of the Flood to theologically argue for an imminent world-wide judgment by fire (2 Peter 3:6-7). Peter argues that just as there was a world-wide judgment by water causing the unbelieving antediluvian world to perish, so in the antitype there must-needs-be a universal end-time judgment by fire bringing about the destruction of the ungodly (see Davidson 1981, p 326-327).  Thirteenth, key terms and motifs that we have already noted in Genesis 6-9 converge to make a major theological statement: the Noahic Flood is nothing less than the cosmic undoing or reversal of creation. Numerous biblical scholars have recognized this highly significant theological point of the Flood narrative. Nahum Sarna writes that ""The Flood is a cosmic catastrophe that is actually the undoing of creation."" In other words, creation is being undone, and the world returned to chaos (Sarna 1989, p 48).  Tikva Frymer-Kensky describes the Flood as ""the original, cosmic undoing of creation"" (Frymer-Kensky 1983, p 410; cf. Frymer-Kensky 1985, p 312). Claus Westermann speaks of the ""invasion of chaos into the created order; the flood assumed cosmic proportions"" (Westermann 1974/1984, p 434). Umberto Cassuto points out that at the high point of the Flood, ""We see water everywhere, as though the world had reverted to its primeval state at the dawn of Creation, when the waters of the Deep submerged everything"" (Cassuto 1964, p 97). David Clines uses the apt term bouleversement or ""reversal"" of creation to depict the theological significance of the Flood (Clines 1972, p 136). For Joseph Blenkinsopp,   ... the deluge is an act of uncreation, undoing the work of separation by returning everything to the primeval, watery chaos from which the created order first arose (Blenkinsopp 1992, p 83; cf. Blenkinsopp 1971, p 46-47).  Gerhard von Rad vividly underscores the universal implications of this undoing or reversal of creation:   ... we must understand the Flood, therefore, as a catastrophe involving the entire cosmos. When the heavenly ocean breaks forth upon the earth below, and the primeval sea beneath the earth, which is restrained by God, now freed from its bonds, gushes up through yawning chasms onto the earth, then there is a destruction of the entire cosmic system according to biblical cosmology. The two halves of the chaotic primeval sea, separated â the one up, the other below â by God's creative government (ch. 1:7-9), are again united; creation begins to sink into chaos. Here the catastrophe, therefore, concerns not only men and beasts ... but the earth (chs. 6.13; 9.1) â indeed, the entire cosmos (von Rad 1972, p 128).  Only a cosmic/universal Flood can theologically encompass the cosmic/universal reversal or undoing of creation described in Genesis 6-9.  Fourteenth and last, the cosmic reversal of creation is followed by a cosmic New Beginning. As Clines states it:   ... the 'uncreation' which God has worked with the Flood is not final; creation has not been permanently undone. Old unities of the natural world are restored (8:22), and the old ordinances of creation are renewed (9:1-7) (Clines 1972-73, p 138).  Jacques Doukhan has shown the precise literary parallels between the successive stages of ""re-creation"" in the aftermath of the Flood (Genesis 8-9) and the seven days of creation in Genesis 1-2 (Doukhan 1987, p 133-134; cf. Gage 1984, p 10-20):   The wind over the earth and waters. Gen. 8:1; cf. Gen. 1:2.   Division of waters. Gen. 8:1-5; cf. Gen. 1:6-8.   Appearance of plants. Gen. 8:6-12; cf. Gen. 1:9-13.   Appearance of light. Gen. 8:13-14; cf. Gen. 1:14-19.   Deliverance of animals. Gen. 8:15-17; cf. Gen. 1:20-23.   Animals together with men, blessing, food for men, image of God. Gen. 8:18-9:7; cf. Gen. 1:24-31.   Sign of covenant. Gen. 9:8-17; cf. Gen. 2:1-3.   Thus in the over-arching literary structure of the ""re-creation"" in the Flood narrative, the universal dimension of the Flood is underscored by detailed parallels with the cosmic creation account of Genesis 1-2.  IV. Conclusion  In conclusion, the question of the extent of the Genesis Flood is not just a matter of idle curiosity with little at stake for Christian faith. For those who see the days of creation in Genesis 1 as six, literal 24-hour days (see Hasel 1994), a universal Flood is an absolute necessity to explain the existence of the geologic column. A literal creation week is inextricably linked with a world-wide flood.  But a universal Flood is crucial not only in seeking to reconcile science and Scripture. It is also pivotal in understanding and remaining faithful to the theology of Genesis 1-11 and the rest of Scripture. (For a more detailed discussion of the theology of the Genesis Flood in its canonical context, see Davidson in press.) The many links with the universal creation in Genesis 1-2 which we have noted in this study not only support the aspect of universality in the Flood, but serve to theologically connect Protology (Creation) and Eschatology (Judgment/Salvation) in the opening chapters of Scripture. The Flood is an eschatological step-by-step ""uncreation"" of the world and humanity followed by a step-by-step ""re-creation"" of the new world. ""Thus,"" writes von Rad, ""the story of the Flood â and this is theologically the most important fact â shows an eschatological world judgment.... The world judgment of the Flood hangs like an iron curtain between this world age and that of the first splendor of creation"" (von Rad 1972, p 129-130).  The theology of the universal Flood is therefore the pivot of a connected but multi-faceted universal theme running through Genesis 1-11 and constituting an over-arching pattern for the entire subsequent world-wide creation revealing the character of the Creator and His original purpose for creation; humankind's turning from the Creator and the universal spread of sin ending in the universal ""uncreation"" through eschatological judgment; and re-creation, in the eschatological salvation of the faithful covenant remnant and the universal renewal of the earth."

fact_831	fact	"You started off with criticizing gun banning, but now you seem to be criticizing tough punishments for criminals. A May 2006 article in the Cape Times said that ""National law currently provides for a sentence of 25 years for illegal firearm possession.""   http://www.capetimes.co.za/index.php...icleId=3230121  So if the death penalty is the punishment for illegal gun possession then I suppose the law must have changed recently. I wonder if the people who claim that we don't need more gun laws but just tougher punishments for people who break current gun laws would support such a penalty."
fact_1500	fact	Given my last paragraph it should be clear why I don't agree with this. I also am not aware of any theories that imply any kind of extratemporal phenomena, only speculations as to what (if anything) may have happened before the Big Bang. If anything did (eg previous Big Crunch) that is not outside time, that is only time that is inaccessible to us in terms of observation.

fact_1567	fact	Tell me, how does a link to a religious nut who thinks the New Testament was first written in Aremic , despite tons of evidence to the contrary, have anything to do with refuting the scientific theory of evolution?
fact_842	fact	The man seemed have a thing about prostitutes. I believe he felt it was his God-given destiny to punish them.  Cybererratus is a very interesting persona. He manifests a number of very interesting character traits. I don't believe that he likes women very much. In fact, I am rather concerned about how Cybererratus feels about women.  Andrea Yates was certifiably insane and her killing of her children had nothing to do with post partum depression.  And, she is being punished. She is serving life in prison -- as is Mr. Ridgway.  I also find the comparisons that Cybererratus makes to be morally troubling.
fact_1573	fact	So you must be against Medicare and Medicaid. I assume you would also be against nationalized healthcare.       The government, rather the supreme court dictators, became involved in the woman's body in 1973. You must be against roe v. wade.
fact_1215	fact	I think that we've got to draw a line at some point, to demarcate between adult and child. Where ever we do draw it, it will seem, in some situations to be arbitrary. If we made it 20, the question would be why 20 year olds and not 19. Through the years society has determined that by 18 people should have attained enough life experience to form intent and to comprehend that their actions have consequences (at least as it applies to the death penalty, they can be tried as adults w/o death). We don't execute people who can't comprehend the nature of their crimes and society says that, under 18 you can't fully comprehend criminal actions.
fact_117	fact	No, but some intelligence should be exercised when going to a court of law.  For example, the choice of the board on WHO to represent them.  Do you think that the judge will be able to totally dismiss in his mind that this group mission is to push a religious agenda?

fact_103	fact	"The dictionary.com definition is vague, whether you use all 5 divisions of the definition, or only the first one that you quoted. I think that's what Grocott was saying - that it's not definable in a precise, non controversial way so that everyone can agree on exactly what it includes and what it does not. Even the word ""phenomena"" is vague.   The reason I said (and maintain) that it's a murky combination of facts and theories is because it can branch off in different ways and follow different paths, depending on the presuppositions (worldviews) of those assigned the duty of directing it. In this case it's the teaching establishment. There is only a finite amount of instruction time in schools. Some paths get more time, attention, and detail allotted to them than do other paths."
fact_895	fact	So it has gone from an indeterminate (based on my quick searches) number of fewer isoforms in lower vertebrates to the 24 found in mammals. That's an increase in information.
fact_881	fact	Well, it happens in virtually every thread.  Some disagreements are between individuals of essentially the same basic system [Protestant Christian vs Protestant Christian], [atheist rationalist vs atheist rationalist].   Many disagreements are between individual of differing belief systems. In such cases the individuals often use the same word to mean two different things.  What is âevidenceâ? Well, that will depend on your core belief system. Sacred writings may be excellent evidence for your belief system, but when you say the Qu'ran proves an issue, the Christian says âThatâs not evidence!â.  One side tries to convince the other side that their core beliefs are incorrect, so they really have no evidence for their position.
fact_659	fact	so hypothetically, if there was a ghost in the machine, what type of signs or signals would have to exist to convince you that it was there? Is it not enough that thoughts and sensations can lead to physical changes and even to turning genes On or Off?  Just to clarify though, I think the non-physical and the physical are one in the same....this explains the above phenomenon of thoughts and sensations corresponding to physical changes.

fact_1995	fact	What good is that when most cases involving firearms offenses never make it to the full court? Anytime you have the potential to put somebody away for a great many years because they have a felony record and were arrested and in possession of a gun, the possession charges always get dropped and a plea deal is offered.
fact_2244	fact	"When did this ""ice age"" take place? Between 4000-4500BC?"
fact_1765	fact	Any geologists want to help me out here?  What they mean by this is that there are sediments in one place and sediments in another place. They can date them radiometrically to determine that they are both from the Edicarian period (even though they may be seperated by millions of years). They then verify that they are Edicarian by looking at the layering to determine if the two pieces were at one point connected, but are now seperated due to tectonics.  I'm sure I'm not entirely correct about these methods.  I think I'd better study up on some of these qeustions HERE.  Maybe you should too.
fact_1003	fact	So the local police did respond.
fact_1017	fact	Because there's absolutely no due process in this proposal. Your name is on the list, your rights are revoked. That's not due process. There's no court of law, no trial, no verdict, no attorneys, no chance for the accused to defend themselves, etc.   We still haven't forgotten the Homeland Security memo that said veterans and those opposed to abortion could be potential terrorists.
fact_2278	fact	Fossils are evidence, not theory. They can be used in the construction of any theory, including creationism. Whether this is 'just' or not, is another issue. I point this out as many seem confused about evidence, and think that it just points to something without interpretation
fact_1771	fact	Count me as one of those 14% since he hasn't demonstrated anything of the sort. And it isn't imposing our religion on anyone at all just because we rely on scriptural values in determining what is right and wrong in life. This is the greatest corruption of common sense that can be revealed regarding how the humanist thinks.   What better way to erase scriptural based morality from the public debate than to assert that just by holding to a biblical value system in life is to impose ones religion on the atheist? This is the goal and defines the agenda of the atheist as it proves that at every level of public discourse it is their goal to claim that any spiritually based value system which opposes secular humanism, opposes the Constitution which couldn't be further from the original intent of the Constitution if it tried. The constitution was neither anti-bible or anti-christian. Nor was it anti-spiritual interpretation or application of the laws of the land which is evident by those very laws which exist and compliment spiritual values of christian americans throughout our history.  So your not very interesting opinion piece by these so called intellectuals fail on all counts as they must pervert and corrupt what has always been accepted values in this Country in order to reinterpret history if they hope to succeed in this application.
fact_498	fact	Oh come on Steeeeve, around 50% of fertilized embroyo's will fail to implant anyway, so nature 'has killed/'is killing' half of all the people who have ever existed anyway. You cannot tell me that none of those are not just fluke losses of otherwise perfectly healthly embryos.  Also, prevention of implantation is only one of several mechanisms by which emergency contraception works- it also prevents ovulation, disrupts passage of a released egg and inhibits fertilzation occuring in the first place.

fact_301	fact	Yes, brains in a vat, the Matrix, and Last Thursdayism are unprovable. That is why science has been so successful - it only deals with naturalistic explanations for naturalistic phenomena. An unconstrained supernatural force can provide an answer for anything (fossils in the ground, complexity in organisms, etc.) but will provide an explanation for nothing. Science is in the business of providing explanations - philosophy is down the hall and on your left.
fact_2287	fact	Although few mothers would do such a thing, I think that it is clear a mother would have the same right to do this as with a world-famous violinist. The fact that we would disapprove of such a women is not really important: emotive reactions don't constitute proof. If they did, the writer could simply say: 'I think women who have abortions are terrible' and his job would be done.  I'm dubious about the whole human rights basis of much modern debate on issues like abortion - I support neither the premises, reasoning or conclusion of the violinist argument. But this whole counter-argument seems to me extremely weak.
fact_1956	fact	Actually, you are living in the past. That DNA changes is neither an assumption nor a prediction. It is an observation.
fact_467	fact	Try Islam. Even though many wars have been waged under the guise of Christianity, Jesus never preached that humans should force people to believe as we do. Muhammed, on the other hand, openly condones the spread of Islam by the sword.  Look at Mormons. I do not consider them Christian, though you may not make that distinction. They are the most tireless of all.
fact_329	fact	"You know, I'm all for punny jokes (even moreso than most people), but that's not what I meant.

fact_2324	fact	So basically, you're saying you know they have a legal criteria for what constitutes civil rights, and in the same section you say you aren't a lawyer, and that you can't track it down. Interesting. Since you aren't backing it up and essentially admit that you can't, then your claim will be taken for what little it's worth. :)

fact_2318	fact	"So what?  Most of them are still getting killed with guns.   A Red Herring is a fallacy in which an irrelevant topic is presented in order to divert attention from the original issue. The basic idea is to ""win"" an argument by leading attention away from the argument and to another topic. This sort of ""reasoning"" has the following form:  1. Topic A is under discussion.  2. Topic B is introduced under the guise of being relevant to topic A (when   topic B is actually not relevant to topic A).  3. Topic A is abandoned."
fact_1177	fact	Of course it shouldn't be used as birth control, but because of religious ignorance against birth control, in any form, so many don't have easy access, or even proper education about such things.  Places which have proper access and education have far fewer unwanted pregancies as well. The USA has twice as many unwanted pregancies as Canada and I think 36 times as many as Japan.  BTW, an interesting fact is that the USA (280 million} is now the 3rd most populous nation in the world right after China (1.3 billion), and India (1 billion). The former USSR had been 3rd, I think, with a little over 300 million.
fact_1163	fact	There's no mention of gays in the constitution.
fact_1605	fact	Well yes, but thats not what DEFECTIVE GULO indicates. If one has external sources of vitamin C, GULO can mutate to be inactive without causing a problem, and once inactive the inactive gene can be inherited without causing problems so long as vitamin C intake is high enough. An inactive GULO indicates that the species has external sources of vitamin C which is essential to many metabolic processes.
fact_507	fact	"see, in the US we have a thing called ""laws"" and these ""laws"" are what the courts are supposed to go by. What their personal feelings that have are not relevant to any court case (or shouldn't be that is). So yes, it was the correct decision based on the laws.  As a side note, if you wish to change a law we have a congress that does that."
fact_1836	fact	Actually, in regards to possession by felons, they are not petty weapons charges-at least in Virginia. Say for example you catch a crack dealer with a gun. He could get anywhere from a minimum of 5 years up to 40 years for selling crack, but in my experie

fact_1188	fact	Not knowing isn't the same as claiming magic.
fact_275	fact	"Jyoshu pretty much answered for me so I won't go back but I will say that your morality is formed based on arbitrary things as well. Whether you believe in a god or make yourself god you still are making arbitrary rules for which you develop a morality.  The idea that you don't want to suffer and therefore came up with this morality is abritrary as everything we have stated. Why wasn't the conclusion ""I dont' want to suffer so be stronger than everyone else"" or ""I don't want to suffer so don't associate with anyone else"". Or maybe the conslusion could be to believe in a religion. Either way, you are going to have to believe in something and that forms the basis for a morality."
fact_513	fact	60% accepting Roe v Wade is a high figure don't you think? More people support abortion then the president.
fact_1822	fact	I'm not sure what the means. I think that you have been listening to the creationist version of evolutionary biology. As an evolutionary biologist I've never heard anything like that.

fact_2126	fact	Actually, when I opened this picture it appeared to be approximately 6 inches tall. Upon just a quick glance, I determined that this was the skeletal remains of an ancient smurf. My God man! You have just confirmed the existence of Papasmurfidae!   I wouldn't pontificate on the nature of the scriptures based upon a quick glance any more than I would attempt to determine the origin of the species by glossing through Ask Jeeves. I can tell you however that jacob begetting enoch and enoch begetting Ralph, etc etc etc, does not approach the current acceptable age of the earth Sir. Even if you allow for Methuselah to live 900 years. Describe the shape of your skull sir. Perhaps a break through awaits. As for my own skull, it is deforming with each successive post from repeated blows to the forehead by my open palm.   If the lack of complete records has you befuddled, consider my own curiousity at the utter dearth of evidence for a planet of an age described in the bible. Evolutionists may not have all of the puzzle pieces in place, but one can determine what the picture looks like. I can't think of one piece that would support the view to which you subscribe.
fact_2132	fact	IF! But here's the thing, Mexico is making absolutely no attempt to truly stomp out the drug cartels, they're catering to them!

fact_1413	fact	Well, that's not quite right. Science is a methodology for investigating phenomena, not an enumeration of them. So it is perfectly possible to scientifically investigate, say, the power of prayer.   Consider for a moment what you actually mean by 'materialistically': what is it that defines something as being material? Gravity is every bit as intangible as a miracle, yet you would automatically characterise it as being part of the material world. Why? The answer is that it is amenable to the scientific method: assertions about gravity can be repeatably tested. If ghosts and poltergeists were amenable to the same methodology, it would be possible to construct scientific theories concerning those, too, and they would be considered no more exotic or 'supernatural' than clouds or rainbows.  When you get your head around that, it's immediately apparent that it isn't the power of prayer or spirituality per se that aren't scientific, it's the methodology people have for dealing with them. Indeed, when the scientific method is applied and doesn't yield the results believers in such matters want, the typical response is to come up with excuses why we shouldn't expect the scientific method to work. Unfortunately you can't have it both ways; if you want to come to the party you have to adopt the dress code.  Really, none of this would be a problem if science didn't have a (from a religious perspective) nasty habit of finding explanations for, or hidden and unexpected complexities within, features of the material world about which religious texts or leaders had already made firm pronouncements. Because despite the fact that you, SS, and others see science and evolution as an enemy of your philosophy and spirituality, the actual bone of contention is always in the material world. So who's really treading on whose toes here? It's your choice to shackle your spirituality to a particular - and demonstrably wrong - version of material events, SS, not mine.
fact_922	fact	"OMG. Here we go again.  Please tell us on what basis the state is better able to determine the future of a woman's pregnancy than she herself is.

State ""A"" bans abortions; state ""B"" permits them under most circumstances.  1. What sanction does State ""A"" put in place to punish those who have abortions within its borders? Upon whom is the sanction applied? The woman? The doctor?  2. How does state ""A"" prevent its citizens from traveling to state ""B"" to have the abortion performed?  3.

fact_1407	fact	See above
fact_936	fact	Well memory is NOT something that is immaterial is it. Its always implemented in the form of material processes well known to biochemistry. Metabolism, ion flows, neuron activity and interconnections, along with potentiation of those connections into networks.  Free-will of course is what we call the experience of our choices being not wholly determined by external states alone. By no means does that exclude the fact that our internal states (of which we are largely ignorant) also play a role. The autonomy arises from the operation of the brain and those internal states. Again a purely materialist explanation. And there is no evidence of anything other than material processes in the experience of free-will. In other words neither memory nor free-will require a non-materialist viewpoint.
fact_1361	fact	I think it's true. Why would someone make that up and pass it off as a real event?      I think the continents probably started separating some time after that, which is how God separated the people.

fact_738	fact	A model of a live fish and fossils of a fish are going to be significantly different under any circumstances.  There was a gap in the fossil record, scientists looked it at it, and using the theory of evolution mindset, automatically assumed that it went extinct millions and millions of years ago. But of course, it was absolutely wrong.  A prediction was made based on the theory of evolution and it was absolutely wrong. Simple.

fact_937	fact	"It has nothing to do with ""evolutionists"" and ""creationists"". Some people are confused about relativity theory. According to relativity, the speed of light is constant, so a lightyear is a constant. The speed of light is unaffected by any changes in the observer's time frame caused by gravity or speed. Regardless of whether we sit in a black hole, a white hole, a bounded universe or an unbounded one, if light from a star has taken 10 billion years to reach us, then the universe is at least 10 billion years old."

fact_1360	fact	Where did Vitter lie ? He admitted his wrong doing and apologised to his wife. Had a liberal been accused he would have attacked the leak as a Right Wing attack designed to destroy him with the politics of personal destruction. The double standards are a joke. Out of 10,000 different names she has released, do you really think there are no Democrats on that list ? But ABC has those phone records so they can release a different Republican on the list every month to demonize the Right while never exposing the libs on the list, thereby creating a totally false impression of the real story that people from both sides of the aisle are guilty of indiscretions.
fact_1374	fact	And certain versions of Mark:  15He said to them, âGo into all the world and preach the good news to all creation. 16Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned. 17And these signs will accompany those who believe: In my name they will drive out demons; they will speak in new tongues; 18they will pick up snakes with their hands; and when they drink deadly poison, it will not hurt them at all; they will place their hands on sick people, and they will get well.â  Are they mistakenly reading this?
fact_923	fact	It's possible that Archaeopteryx is not a direct descendant of modern birds but it's certainly not far from the line and it shares both avian and therepodian characteristics.
fact_1412	fact	No, you are mistaken. Evolution is concerned with the change in allele frequency over time.
fact_2133	fact	Oh no, I completely hit the point and exposed it for what it is. Your continuing to compare the ID concept to a flat earth belief proves my point even more. That and the fact that you referred to the flying spaghetti monster seven times in your last post.
fact_1348	fact	Although I'm not keen on them describing things as living fossils (the term is misleading) the possibilities and implications of this are fascinating. I'd be interested to see the paper if anyone has a PDF. It would seem to suggest that the origins of this particular molecule go back to the Ordovician at least, prior to the reptile/mammal split. Anyway, thought people might be interested :)
fact_2127	fact	Actually, if you know what you are talking about even a quick glance will tell you that you are wrong. Of course, paleoanthropologists who study such fossils do more than take a quick glance at it.
fact_248	fact	"First off, define ""government funded"". The FBI? The CIA? Other federal law enforcement agencies? The military? All vital government entities that are and should be armed.   The fact that governments around the world have killed their own citizens after disarming them does not mean that they should not be armed, it means that the citizens should not be disarmed. Think of what our country would have become over the last 100 years without an armed government."
fact_274	fact	just curious...what do you do for a living?
fact_1823	fact	"What's a ""kind""? Of course, evolution is a slow process so only a fool would expect to see one ""kind"" of animal change into another ""kind."" But there are some quite good examples in the fossil record. The horse and the whale are two. And the dinosaur to bird line is getting better all the time."
fact_512	fact	A fact is simply a phenomenon that is observable by any competent observer. It is not proven.  For example, Euclid made the assumption that one and only one straight line exists between two points. This is generally considered a fact. However, two points that cannot be connected by a straight line could be discovered tomorrow, and that Euclid's first postulate would be disproven.
fact_1837	fact	There is just one thing however. The coelacanths found are different from those in the fossil record. Further, ALL evidence pointed to them being extinct, until we found other evidence, and we changed it. And, to top it off, the article says NEARLY extinct, not COMPLETELY. Although, this article was of course written after the coelocanths were re-discovered. Of course, this has absolutely nothing to do with the theory of evolution, which explains the mechanisms responsible for the change of allele frequencies in populations over time.
fact_506	fact	And terrorists probably kill less people in the US than non terrorists. To even begin to make any kind of meaningful comparison you have to adjust for the fact that there are a lot more people who don't pack heat than those that do in the US.

fact_260	fact	Again, it's not just 'evidence' but 'evidence constructed into a workable theory'.
fact_1162	fact	Well, this gets rather complicated. A very young child does not get to choose his or her adoptive parents. Who decides on who adopts whom depends on the kind of adoption and the policies of the particular adoption system. In private domestic adoption, the birth mother usually gets to decide on who will adopt her baby. The foster care system is organized differently, and international adoption is different still and depends on the country from which the child is being adopted. So it's pretty much impossible to generalize about adoption policies and practices. They vary greatly.  The point is that the purpose of adoption is to protect the rights of the child.

fact_2319	fact	"Creationists need to latch on to the intellectual integrity of science.

fact_1610	fact	Unlike California, amendments in Iowa must pass the legislature first (simple majority) before going to the voters. While I know little about the Iowa legislature, this seems a no brainer in a populace vote, considering previous votes and more current polls on this subject in Iowa. As a rule I lend polls very little credence, but DOMA passed by a wide majority in 1998. I doubt things have changed enough to cover the gap, a lot of traditional values and religious folks in Iowa.
fact_1176	fact	Look over the Heller ruling again. All nine judges agreed unanimously that the Second Amendment protected a right that was wholly individual in nature. The only disagreement was whether the right still applied today.  And no, the individual states and cities shouldn't be allowed to set their own standards for a constitutional right, that flies in the face of the 14th Amendment. And worse, you're arguing for precedent that would basically allow the various states to not respect your other rights; they could ban the shirt you choose to wear because it's offensive to some small, insignificant minority somewhere.
fact_20	fact	"Thanks Patriot for the well researched response.  Although I am not a gun rights advocate, I am also not anti-gun and in the spirit of trying to get the two sides of this issue to reach some sort of understanding, here is what I believe to be the major points of those who support a ban on assult weapons.  First of all, I do agree that the definition of assult weapons is a little strange, and it essentially boils down to the guns that look scary.  However, the spirit of the law was to try to ban weapons whose main purpose was militaristic in nature. That is, guns that are able to be fired rapidly, have a large magazine, and reasonable stopping power. Thus, although the ban would not eliminate all of the ""dangerous"" weapons ( I assume that an M1, the rifle that beat the Nazis, would be legal) it does cover a lot of them.  Of course, most 2nd amendment rights supporters would say that all this doesn't matter, it doesn't matter what purpose the gun serves, it is unconstitutional to infringe upon the rights of Americans to own any gun they want, no matter the purpose.  What gun control advocates would say, however, is that the constitution says 'arms' not guns, and it becomes the job of the goverment to determine what was meant my this. I think that most gun control advocates would agree that the second amendment probably did not intend for people to be able to buy chemical or biological weapons, for example. And, I for one, hope that is not what they meant, particularly in light of the recent war on terrorism.  A common remark is ""why would it matter if I had a nuclear weapon if I am a law abiding citizen and would never use it against my neighbor?"" The problem is that we don't know what the intention of everyone is, and there are certainly terrorists in this country now who are American citizens and would use such powerful weapons against usif they were able to acquire them.  Of course a semi-automatic .223 caliber rifle is not the same as a chemical weapon, but the point is that (I think) most people don't think that you should be able to own absolutely any weapon that you want, so one must attempt to define what is too dangerous for ordinary citizens to own.   I don't think that I covered all of your points, Patriot, but this is getting long, so I will cut this off here, and I hope to get a response from you. I will be interested in your thoughts.  -Dan"

In order to have a right, you have to have a legimimate way in which you can exercize that equal right. That's not possible with hetero-only marriages. There is no special right, it's equalizing it for biological concerns.   Saying homosexuals can get married, but only to heterosexuals is like saying that they HAVE the right, but they have to go against their biological/mental state in order to exercize that. That's unreasonable. Of course, prior to this debate, Blacks COULD get married, but only proper marriage was between members of the same race. emoticonXRolleyes They have the same, equal rights!

fact_2286	fact	Again, you're going to have to explain what relevance the difficulties we have forecasting the behaviour of a complex, chaotic system has to the straightforward observation of galaxies. I mean, they're galaxies. Right there, in a picture in front of you. I'm struggling to understand what you think can have gone wrong :)  Let's use the same kind of analogy you've employed. If I want to take a picture of a basketball, I can do that close up, right? But if I want to take a picture of 1500 basketballs, all spaced out, I have no option but to do so from further away. With a standard 28mm lens on a 35mm camera, and allowing 4 square feet of floor per basketball, I would need to be roughly 90 feet up in the air to fit them all in the frame.  Now imagine I want to take that same picture with an extreme telephoto lens, equivalent to peeking through a dime-sized hole seventy-five feet away. In order to see all those basketballs through that hole, they're going to have to be a bit further away. Almost nineteen miles in fact.  Now make them 1500 earth-sized planets. It's a straightforward scaling up of similar triangles: now I'd have to be almost 2,000,000,000 miles away. 1500 suns? 217,011,334,736 miles away. 1500 solar systems (just out to pluto, not including the comets)? 919,679,070,315,789 miles away, or 156LY. If we include the comets, that becomes 2,299,197,675,789,472,500 miles.  But we aren't looking at basketballs, planets, or solar systems. We're looking at galaxies, giving us a whopping 145,473,622,268,931,148,838,190 miles or 24,746,725,672 LY. Now, that's actually rather more than the measured distance to those galaxies, mainly because I'm assuming they're all laid out flat. To get a more accurate estimate we need to think about looking through a 'cone' of space, with galaxies at different distances.  But I dunno - maybe I'm just swallowing all this without really thinking about it ;)

fact_1764	fact	Thank you for your reply kelvin90701.  I will give my thoughts on all of your points soon, for now, I am just leaving, so I will just inquire as to what you mean on part of your post. Specifically, the following:  The WMD analogy is poor. You will not find any vendors. Please find another one. There may be Constitutionally poor arguments in favor of banning WMDs for civilians, that argument is moot. You will not find any vendor. The Constitution protects my right to own arms. That does not mean arms vendors must be forced to sell thier product to me if I want one. That argument is moot.  So, what you are saying, is there is no constitutional protection given to the manufacturer of weapons. That is, it would be constitutional to ban the manufacture of guns?   If so, would it still be OK, for an American citizen to buy any weapon that they would want from a foreign government/manufacturere, etc?  Again, thank you for your response.  -Dan

Note that many animals don't look into each others eyes (most herbivours; since they have near-360 degree vision, eyes convey almost no information), and many animals take different information from them than we do (cats for example take looking at them as hostile behaviour, and narrowing the eyes and looking away as friendly).

I prefer to use the term ""spontaneous origin"" rather than ""evolution""). since creationism and the collection of spontaneous origin theories are mutually exclusive and cannot coexist, then upon proving either you automatically disprove the other. and if a 3rd unforseen theory is proven as the real way life originated on earth, then it would automatically disprove the both creationism and the current spontaneous origin theories  the 2 concepts are pretty much diametrically opposed right now, both competing for evidence to support its case, and a strengthening of one theory automatically implies a weakening of the other"

Evolution is therefore more deserving of being called fact than gravity is.

Correlational studies like this one can not determine cause and effect.
fact_869	fact	I did not say that I agree with a tax incline, and perhaps that is a discussion for a different time. However there is a difference that I should point out. There is a reason for the tax incline: those with little money will suffer a lot more if they have to pay hijgher taxes. Those with high taxes are much more able to give money without losing those things essential to a decent standard of living. Is it equal? Interestingly it could be viewed as an attempt to give everyone a more equal income, however it could also be viewed as an inequality involving one group of people paying lots of taxes and another group paying not as much. I won't debate whether it is the type of equality we want to promote, I'll just assume that a tax incline removes equality. But remember, there is a reason behind that tax incline. The goal of government is to promote happiness as much as possible. In this case, the government could be viewed as sacrificing equality in favor of happiness. But whether that tradeoff is really working or is really a good idea is all up for debate. The point is: there is reasoning behind a tax incline based on income. There is no good reason behind giving marriage benefits to people based on their sex and there are plenty of reasons to do just the opposite. Or at least it is my goal to prove that in these posts.

fact_2079	fact	"""What is true, Ricker says, is that gun manufacturers have long known that distributors and retailers supply thousands of guns each year to criminals, and yet gun makers deliberately look the other way. ""  The quote says it all. That attitude breaks many cornerstone laws regarding personal responsibility. Manufactures are NOT responsible for customers illegal activity.  GM and Ford know that 100% of all the product they sell will be used illegally. Everyone of their cars will be used to break speed limits. No one obeys speed limts, the only time speed limits are obeyed is when a cop is watching. Yet GM and Ford are not responsible for all the illegal activity of their products.  Shifting the responsbility for enforcement breaks many traditions and laws regarding individual personal responsibility. When a customer breaks a law using a product, manufactures are not responsible, that goes for both guns and cars, or any product that is sold and used for criminal purposes.  There certainly a lack of cooperation between the ATF and the NRA. They really should be working together. It takes two sides to make a conflict. The ATF is trying to single out gun manufactures to be responsible for policing customers. NO OTHER INDUSTRY is being held accountable like that. That is why there is a conflict between the NRA and ATF. The NRA asks that gun manufactures to be treated with the same consideration of existing laws and standards applied to other industries. The NRA supports any efforts to take firearms away from criminals, but they are asking that gun manufactures not be held accountable for customer illegal activity. Which is the position of every single product manufacturer not matter what you make and sell.  It is not that gun manufactures are looking away, they do. So does every other manufacture who makes any other product."

fact_100	fact	You are perhaps thinking of the Miller-Urrey experiment. No one expected life to appear. They were merely curious about what would happen if they simulated the conditions of the early Earth.  Since then, we've found pretty much the same thing in the interior of stony meteorites, including an excess of L-forms. So, it's confirmed the findings of Miller-Urey. None of this has anything to do with evolution, however.  Evolution is the change in allele frequencies over time. This happens in populations; individuals don't evolve. Everything else in evolution is an elaboration of this phenomenon.

An embryo or fetus is something starting to develop into a human and that can't be stopped without killing it or injecting differnt DNA, but it's still not too different from sperm and ovum.  If you can't trust the church to make fair decisions and follow values and morals and rules they put in place, how can you expect an honest good decision about anything from it.

Why are there no robins, eagles, vultures, chickens, emus, frogs, turtles, lizards, alligators, sharks, carp, perch, dolphins, whales, seals, foxes, rabbits, cats, dogs, deer, antelope, zebra, horses, kangaroos, elephants, bats, monkeys, chimps, humans, and so on in the Burgess Shale or other Cambrian strata? Evolution has a perfectly reasonable, and supported, explanation.

You can't be prosecuted for a crime that you didn't commit, and for which there is no evidence to link you to it. But that's not good enough for Bloomberg, oh no. Bloomberg wants to ATF to view anyone attending a gun show as absolutely guilty, and subject to arrest, detainment and prosecution without evidence or witnesses, thus violating a person's Sixth Amendment rights.  And as I said before. Bloomberg makes absolutely no recommendation for what to do with these 35, supposedly, criminals sellers. He didn't want them charged with felonies, he didn't file civil suits against them, he didn't do anything. He just got the ""evidence"" he wanted and then he let them go scot free as if they'd done nothing. Obviously New York City style catch and release justice at its absolute finest.

fact_1000	fact	"I learned a few things from the post. The author claimed ""most households donât have guns"". According to 1997 stats, 25% of ALL US adults owned firearms. If you assume that there are typically two adults per household, that means 50% of households have guns, so the statement is false.  On a personal note, someone tried to break into my brother's apartment shortly after he was married. He quickly opened the door, yelled ""freeze MFer or I'll XXXX your head off!"" while holding a short-barrelled shotgun and watched the perp #### himself. being half asleep and in possession of a slightly modified shotgun, my brother didn't call the cops to report this self-defensive use of a firearm."
fact_1766	fact	I'm not going to even mention how perilous common sense is. I'm confused by your statements about all animals having brains and consiousness. Your first assirtion is wrong because some organisms, like sponges and jellyfish, do not require a centralized nervous system. Your second assertion is nonesensical and incorrect according to classic Christion dogma. You have no definition for consiousness so potentially even plants have some, making your assertion meaningless. Animals would all have enough consiousness to do what they needed to fill their niche, and this would be caused by slow natural selection, not by holy edict. By the way, most pastors I'm familiar with would tell you animals don't go to heaven because they are both soulless and lack conscious thought. As to you stating God gave animals the ability to change to their environment, do you have evidence of massive bodily changes? Tell your assertion to the millions upon millions of species that have gone extint in Earth's history because of changing enviroments or more powerful competition.
fact_2284	fact	But wait, you said that science is unprovable. How did we build up the world, conquer the air, sea and space without unprovable science?!
fact_1955	fact	And since this is inarguable, empirical fact, we're fairly safe in saying so :)
fact_464	fact	"In the theory of evolution, it all started with life. I know that you have been told that the big bang theory is part of evolution. It's not. The word evolution means change. In some situations it still has a meaning that it had back in Victorian times. It meant change in a particular direction, as in stelar evolution - stars ""evolve"" in predictable ways. It also sometimes carries the connotation of progress. But none of these meanings are applicable to theories of biological evolution. There is no concept of purpose or direction to the word when used in a biological context.  Here is a more precise definition of evolution: evolution is a change in the heritable characteristics of a population of living organisms over generations. When scientist or a knowledgable amateur speaks of the ""theory of evolution,"" it is this theory that is being discussed. Unmodified, the term has come to mean biological evolution. Those who include the big bang (cosmological evolution) or the formation, life and death of stars (stelar evolution) are either ignorant or dishonest. Even the question of the origin of life is irrelevant. One may postulate a magical, all powerful being that created the first life. The theories of evolution attempt to explain how life changes and has changed over time."
fact_302	fact	This was done in my post #7 of this thread.   I showed that the research articles NARTH claims to quote say something COMPLETELY DIFFERENT than what NARTH pretends...
fact_316	fact	Since we have observed it happening in the case of the nylon bug, it cannot be the obstacle you presume :)  It's easy to get lost in abstract concerns about 'information'. For instance, imagine a lock with a three-digit code, like those on briefcases. It's easy to get in if you know the code, but it's also perfectly possible to get in without knowing the code - it just takes longer. If you're right about the way information works, that oughtn't to be possible.  The crucial point is that the lock contains all the information required to open it. That information is transferred to the person trying to open it via feedback: when you get the right code, the case opens. If there was no feedback - if the person was not actually opening the case themselves but was just blindly shouting numbers for someone else to try with no idea if it was working or not - they would be none the wiser.  Similarly, the nylon waste products metabolised by the nylon bug intrinsically possess all the necessary information concerning how they can be broken down. That information is transferred to the bacteria via the feedback of natural selection: the bugs who hit upon the right combination survive, and those who do not, perish. In this manner information about how to survive in the present environment is transferred from the environment and encoded in the genome. No information is being created, it is merely being moved around.
fact_1941	fact	I didn't say anything about anyone 'breaking the law.' I'm just showing you a different perspective of the events from a witness--you know, giving you MORE information from which to draw conclusions. Or did you only WANT your information limited to one version of the story, mainly from the account of the one who got booted?? I think it was simply a private screening, and the people running the private screening didn't want them there. That's their prerogative, as it was obviously a private screening and that's the way it works. Again, read the comments on the blog I linked to as they include comments from people who were there, including more from Stuart and at least one by PZ Myers himself.
fact_470	fact	"So it's just a coincidence that nations that ban guns like England have much lower levels of gun violence and murder than the US? That's kind of hard to believe. NYC was so effective in reducing crime that the mayor of NYC was invited to Mexico City to help them reduce crime there. So I don't think the possibility that gun control has been effective in cities like NYC can be ruled out. You may be confusing cause and effect. You wouldn't walk into a hospital and declare that because there are a lot of sick people in a hospital that hospitals don't help people get better.  That website starts off with the rumor that there are over 20,000 gun laws. Although this claim has been repeated numerous times by anti gun-control activists, has anybody been able to verify this claim? A recent study that counted the number of gun laws found ""only 300 relevant federal and state laws regarding the manufacture, design, sale, purchase, or possession of guns.""  http://releases.usnewswire.com/GetRelease.asp?id=12007  Another reason not to put too must trust in biased websites that cherry pick the facts."
fact_1799	fact	No, but the first trimester makes my point stronger, and given that 95-98% of abortions happen then it is a valid distinction.
fact_2290	fact	Nice spin by way of projection but you are wrong as usual. I find your defination of your position to be too funny. Like it is some how wrong to turn the tables on the left by using their methods. You still fail to address the fact of liberal firearm owners. Or is the fact of owning a firearm enough to have one drummed out of the liberal camp, buttons ripped off and sword broken? emoticonXBye
fact_1969	fact	But my point is that the Supreme Court has disagreed. Hence the illegitimate legal doctrine of substantive due process, which maintains that the due process clause can be violated even in cases where due process has been given.
fact_458	fact	oh because for the past decade or so they have been indoctrinated into hating alleged liberal activities (let's ignore the fact that without liberalism there would be no USA!)  Extreme enviromentalism is nuts. Extreme industry is nuts. To be sane and happy, there must be a middle ground.
fact_2333	fact	"We're legally dead when we no longer mentally exist (hence the term ""brain-dead""), so there is no logical reason to set the beginning point as anything other than the start of the mental existence. Just as people who are dead and without mental existence do not have the ability to obtain rights, a collection of human cells without a mental existence cannot obtain rights.   I also notice you have resorted to attacking other people's views rather than following the topic of the thread, which is to share YOUR views. emoticonXBanghead"

fact_2327	fact	"So this list was a surprise to you? This isn't the first time that the ""challange to come up with one scientist who believed that humans do not share common ancestry with apes"" has come up on these forums. When refuted, the goal posts move, and it's shown how several scientists who don't believe in common ancestry are dwarfed by percentages of those who do, with of course, a dose of ridicule thrown in. Is that how students are sometimes ""educated"" in today's universities? A false implication is made to belittle creation as much as possible, and if not questioned, is quickly built upon? And if questioned, the goalposts are moved and the questioner is riduculed?"
fact_36	fact	Yes, it is against the law in most states to do that.
fact_1606	fact	That's because its sophistry. Its an inherent contradiction and it simply means we don't have the capacity to understand it. Another more common example is that the assertion that the universe cannot be endless, and yet as far as we know it is. Trying to understand it is for us humans like an ant trying to fathom the theory of relativity.  Damn are we ever conceited as a race...we seem to think that if we can't understand something, it cannot be. We also tend to think, in every generation, that we have achieved somehow the pinnacle of progress.
fact_1160	fact	"Now you're claiming that a gun is a precision machine. Before you've claimed that the guns you classify as ""assault weapons"" are ""inaccurate and designed for be fired from the hip"". Which is it?"
fact_289	fact	"And wrong again. Hypotheses become theories once ""enough scientists reproduce the same results repeatedl"" as you crudely phrase it. Laws deal with tiny parts of the theory that can be expressed in simple mathematical terms. Natural selection is in it's basic form a law. But there is masses more to it than a simple law, so it gets to be a theory. Theories are the pinacle of achievement in science: they are, in simple laymen's terms, fact."
fact_1174	fact	**  Which is true, [see above], but which is nothing to be ashamed of, since it applies to anyone, including myself, who feels motivated to debate philosophy. And although many darwinists kid themselves that they are here to debate 'science', they are not. They are here to defend their metaphysics and its place in their personal psychological identity, i.e., ego, against the metaphysics of others, just like everybody else.  What is so very strange and unnatural, IMHO, about many materialist/mechanist/positivist/darwinist/atheists is that they will go to great lengths to deny that that is the worldview that their ego revolves around, and will always attempt to convince themselves and others that they are actually somebody else. Somebody utterly uninfluenced, psychologically, by any worldview, any metaphysic, any particular set of unconscious assumptions and prejudgements, at all. The rest of us are proud of the intellectual sub-strate upon which our opinions are based, be those opinions open to challenge or not. So why are materialist/mechanist/darwinists so often ashamed of being identified as such? Beats me.
fact_1612	fact	"But if the Bible is the Word of God, then it is the truth, is it not? Hence, this would be far more reliable than man-made methods. You interestingly enough bring up the so-called ""scientific dating methods"". Well, did you know that out of the 200 possible dating methods that we can apply, only 20 of those methods bring an age for things that fits with the evolutionary theory. Since you have some education in paleontology I trust that you know that most fossils do not usually contain radioactive minerals, so they cannot usually be dated by radiometric means. What is usually done is to find a volcanic flow in association with the fossil layer, and try to date that using methods such as the potassium-argon dating. Now, there have been several examples where radio-dating methods have failed.  In the ""Creation Magazine"" there have been detailed reprots in which wood found in ""250-million-year-old"" sandstone, or in volcanic rock ""tens of millions of years old"" has given carbon-dating results of only thousands of years. Now you should know that if the wood was really 250 million years old there would be no radio-carbon isotopes in the wood. Radio-carbon dating only gives dates limited to a few thousand years according to evolutionary theory. So now comes the question, which one are you going to trust? This example came from: Snelling, A., ""Radioactive dating in conflict!"", Creation 20(1):24-27, 1998. Also when creation geologists sample volcanic rock known to have flowed in historic times, sending it to reputable radiometric dating labs, such as Oxford, the ""dating"" almost invariably gives results in the millions of years! This came from: Snelling, A., ""Radioactive Dating Failure"", Creation 22(1):18-21, 2000. This strongly suggests that the assumptions behind the dating methods are flawed. Now creationists don't have all the answers when it comes to radio-active dating, but they know that there is something wrong with it, examplified by the examples above."
fact_510	fact	There's a difference between these tests.  Accipitridae, (and you by implication that you've not picked it up and called him to task) are mixing up the ancestory of individuals - giving a list of every single member of a family, to that of a species by species account. The difference is both of scale, and testability; written records aren't as long lasting as biological ones. You should be able to use science for whole species ancestory; after-all scientists can tell us with confidence that chimps are near relations, gorillas relations a bit further removed etc.   Or, should we question those that tell us chimps are near relations?
fact_1821	fact	See Sarge's post about Ted Kennedy being listed. What did he do that would make him get on the terrorist watch list?  And what about the four year old boy who was denied flight because his name was also on the watch list? Because his name was the alias of a known terrorist.  What answers do you have to address these points?  We've had plenty of people claiming that being on the no fly list, or the suspected terrorist watch list, should be all the criteria necessary for denying a person the right to buy a gun. And now we have the mayors claiming that failing the background check -even if it's because the Attorney General is abusing his power- should be grounds for criminal prosecution.  That's not liberty. That's not justice. That's not freedom. That's not American values. That's completely unacceptable, and goes on the show the character of those who support gun control. Secret police and secret courts to be used against the American people will not be tolerated!
fact_276	fact	Evolution has no goals, it is merely a beautiful process, like math. Don't deify it. And who cares what we look like?
fact_262	fact	"Were they able to show a previously non-existing code that mutated on a gene somewhere and created this new enzyme activity?   It sounds to me that this ""new"" enzymatic activity came from non-coding dna switching on a gene to produce it. That is what one would expect to find.   ...*Two new enzyme activities, 6-aminohexanoate cyclic dimer hydrolase and 6-aminohexanoate dimer hydrolase, were detected in  the adapted strains.*..."
fact_504	fact	A specific age is picked because it occurs sometime and there is no way to know in any specific individual whether their pre-frontal cortex is up to snuff or not. There is no way to judge on a case-by-case basis. If this occurs (I think it's clear that it does) and if this is a rational reason for treating persons differently (that is, of course, arguable) then the line must be drawn somewhere.   I was wrong to say 18 is arbitrary. I misused the word. I would assume that most people have a mature CNS by that age, so that is why it is picked. The objective evidence of this is done looking at populations, not individuals.   Subjectively, anyone who has kids will know that a young teen's judgement is pretty bizarre at times.

fact_2131	fact	Well there's a new Covenant / Testament. But Jesus declared all foods clean so you can have your pork. Check for trichinellas, which is probably one reason it wasn't on God's preferred list in those unsanitary times.  Recommended study for you: Investigate the different kinds of laws (i.e. moral, civil / tort, ceremonial, dietary). Then look at how these issues are treated in the NT.

fact_909	fact	The fact that they were too heavy, is simply untrue, see previous post. Hunting depends on many ecological factors, such as their predational preference.

fact_2125	fact	I will stop quoting here. Don't want people to have too big a read. Actually ToE isn't all that random. To a certain degree yes. But Sexual Selection aka a part of the ToE. Dictates that when there is a benificial/attractive change. That change will be enhanced almost exponentially. Because the female of the species will be programmed to search for that and will carry the gene herself so will give it to her off spring. And the male will be more succesfull so produce more off spring. So no instant eyes or anything like that. I think that's what you were implying.   Sorry for responding in Kronus's stead. I'm sure he can defend himself but I found it unjust the way you replied to his post and attacked it on foundations that you didn't have.

You know so little that you don't even realize that the names to which you object are not scientific names but names popularized by the press for people, like you, who know so little about it. Scientifically, both Java Man and Peking Man are Homo erectus. They are classified as such because there are no significant differences between them. In fact, there is little difference between Java Man (Trinil 2) and the skull of Nariokotome Boy (KNM-WT 15000), from Africa, or KNM-ER 3733 for that matter.  But you are obsessed with the words. You are so bent out of shape because transitional species between ape-like ancestors and us, that walked upright and used tools are called ""man"". And they aren't assumed to be ancestral. Why don't you learn what you are talking about before you speak. You make yourself look foolish when you speak from ignorance.  ]quote]Regarding the Java Man, How is this skull cap evidence of anything concrete?[/quote]How is it that you think that evidence against your mythology based point of view supports your mythology?"
fact_935	fact	I may want to give a quick reminder that the bible was written by human beings, not a supernatural entity or Jesus. It is very unlikely that Jesus or God had anything to do with the bible, since the bible is not a very righteous, and preaches much hate. People who truely believe in doing good in the world and being followers of God would not even glance at this 2000 year old abomination.
fact_2119	fact	Invalid argument to assert that mutations can map a road outside of their assigned task in illogical, where would the information to do so come from? Biology works because every individual cell doing what it was created to do along with what the one next to it was, though created to perform another set of instructions creates the molecular change that the combination of the cells together would produce. But there is no additional information there... not int he way you assert.
fact_1410	fact	"Yes it is. It will be funded by government money, the taxpayer will foot the bill.  The argument that it will not be ""subsidised"" is based on the ridiculous hypothesis that somehow, someway, it will turn a profit and pay back the enormous injection of public funds needed to start it up (of course, providing an interest-fee-unlimited-repayment-term-loan is in itself, also a subsidy).  If it behaves in such a way as to maximise profit, like its private sector alternatives, what possible purpose does it serve? It's either   a) Pointless. Why don't we also have a ""public option"" pizza restaurant chain and a ""public option"" door to door sales force?  or   b) Very bad.  With about a 99.999% probabilty of b)"
fact_921	fact	"Well, I am a philosophical naturalist and materialist. I don't believe the notion of free will. I think it's all a matter of physics and chemistry.  Be that as it may, whether I am right or wrong about the notion of free will, the consequences of evolution go beyond free will. They go well beyond what humans call good and evil, however we define those.  How about disease, predation, parasitism? Are they the product of an omnibenevolent god? That thought gave Darwin pause. Pain and suffering through natural causes yet through no fault of one's own? How is that a product of a just god?  There are aspects to real life -- some call them the problem of evil -- that are hard for Christians to explain, so many try to explain them away by creating the notion of ""the Fall"". Everything was perfect before ""the Fall"", and terrible afterwards. But that wasn't the way it was. The lion was never an herbivore. The lamb was never fearless of lions.  Pain, suffering and death have always been an integral part of life, and they always will be.Such benevolence. Such justice! And so potent is this toxic religious belief we feel we have to blame outselves for our trials! Or at least, religious believers feel they have to blame themselves.  As an atheist, I see the contradiction between reality and Christian faith. That is why I stopped being a Christian. My learning of evolution and these biological facts of life was a major ingredient in that. I accept that there are Christians who also accept evolution as an historical fact. I question whether they have thought either their faith or their science through."
fact_1376	fact	Someone who does evil things isn't simply not doing good things, he is specifically doing evil. Evil is not the absence of good.
fact_712	fact	Yes I do, but because of time restraints and for lack of a better example that everyone could relate to and understand I used it. There are plenty of good examples of where people believe one thing was true while - infact - something else was true, so the point still stands. A better example (that I probably should have used instead) is that people used to believe that the Earth was the center of the universe, etc. etc. :)
fact_706	fact	I see. So you seem to be having some difficulty in deciding which religion is actually correct. Perhaps none is, since all that you mention are relatively recent inventions of men.  Mr. Kent Hovind is scientifically illiterate and just counts on duping the uneducated. With just a little effort it is possible to learn that Mr. Hovind proposes pseudoscience. Even Answers in Genesis has criticized the points that you find so convincing. I suspect that you too, are scientifically illiterate and lack the knowledge to dicern where he is feeding you a line of crud.  Really, it's not hard to figure out if you have the integrity to look for the real facts. If Hovind is correct, then every scientist in the world, even the Christians, are menbers of a vast conspiracy to deceive you. The very idea is simple minded. Hopefully you will grow up some day.
fact_1389	fact	This is an answer based on either BS or ignorance.  Those without money can use Medicare or Medicaid to virtually pay for the entire pregnancy. WIC also supplements your own feeding IIRC with proteins and calcium products. I've known several people (including hard core conservatives) who've had to go this route 'because they couldn't afford a pregnancy'. And if your morality/ ethics prevents you from taking gov't funding, think of it as stuff you already paid for with taxes (now and later), you're just getting some of what you put in back.  Furthermore, there are several agencies that would easily pay for all your needs provided you put the child up for adoption.
fact_707	fact	So you have no problem with UK gun laws?      Your hypothetical is just that - hypothetical. In reality, a militia would stand small chance against military might.
fact_1388	fact	In what universe is there a right to murder?  Unfortunately, we in the United States have only recently recognized that abusing children and owning slaves is not a right.  And, only recently have women enjoyed the right to vote in the United States.  What certain activities are forbidden in public?  Some of the conservative red states have only recently decreed that there should be speek limits. Not for safety reasons, of course.  And, George Walker Bush has guaranteed the right of corporations to dump dangerous chemicals into lakes and rivers and the oceans.
fact_713	fact	Sure. Here is an explanation.      The 14C Method      That is from the Radiocarbon WEB info site by the Waikato Radiocarbon Dating Lab of the University of Waikato (New Zeland).      That's how I think it works, so the ball in in your court now.
fact_920	fact	That's not evolution. Life has evolved in the lab, many times.
fact_1411	fact	I agree with you to some extent. First, the Mr. Hayes was convicted of this crime before the Lautenberg Amendment was passed. Secondly, Virginian law (where the case originates from) makes no distinction between a domestic relationship (that which he was tried and convicted of) and between the agressor.  Quote majority ruling:  A domestic relationship, although it must be established beyond a reasonable doubt in a Â§922(g)(9) firearms possession prosecution, need not be a defining element of the predicate offense. Pp. 4â13.  Bulldung.  If congress wanted to make it simpler they would have just said battery instead of domestic violence. How the heck they came up with that is beyond me. They basically expanded the meaning of the Lautenberg Amendment, which is a big NO NO! I think that is what Justice Roberts was saying in his dissent.  Quote Justice Roberts dissent:  That reading does not require the specified domestic relationship in clause (ii) to be an element of the predicate misdemeanor statute. Individuals convicted under generic use-of-force statutes containing no reference to domestic violence would there-fore be subject to prosecution under Â§922(g)(9).  ....  The majority also points out that interpreting âcommit-ted byâ to modify the âuseâ of force would render the wordâcommittedâ superfluous. That may be so, but as shown, reading âcommitted byâ to modify âoffenseâ has its own flaws. All this goes to show that the statute is not an example of elegant syntax under either reading. The majority properly acknowledges that, under its view, the statutory language reflects âless-than-meticulous draftingâ and âsyntactical awkwardness,â and âis not a model of the careful drafterâs art.â Ante, at 6, 12, 13. I am willing to acknowledge the same with respect to my reading. But I conclude from such reciprocal shortcomings that the text is at least ambiguous.  Which is why this law needs to be rewritten.  There is a lot more, but I find the majority decision hard to believe. It just doesn't make sense (well to me that is.)  BTW, this by no means I support Domestic Violent offenders, etc. On the contrary, I believe they should lose their gun rights if convicted of domestic violence, BUT, this decision is wrong. The pieces do not fit together. That is Mr. Hayes was convicted of battery, not domestic violence. The government screwed up, so he should be walking free right now.
fact_2118	fact	But you know it is more then just that. The poster gave a specific date that is relevant to when abortion was legalized. It shows the poster is being selective and may hold prejudice to fetuses who arenât aborted by legal abortions.

fact_2124	fact	Rahm Emanuel for one. He seems to sum up the message very well.  And then there's Carolyn McCarthy who actually introduced the bill that, if passed into law, would cancel your Second Amendment rights just because your name is on the no fly list.

fact_2130	fact	You've got it backwards, disorder in the universe is increasing, (see entropy).  An increase in complexity does not mean there is an increase in organized matter, the opposite is true.  A random pile of building material is more complex then a house which is created from that same pile of building materials, because that material is now organized.  To make matters worse, organized matter increases entropy because it takes energy to organize it.
fact_1808	fact	And the point was, Benjamin, that it is dishonest to cite the work of others, with no indication that it is the work of others. If you take what someone else wrote, they you need to indicate that, telling where you got it. If it is a book, then the author, title, publisher, date and page. If it is a web page, then the URL should be given.  Even better, express your own point and tell how reference supports it. Tell why it is important and why it shows your opponent wrong - then just give a link. Generally AIG is really bad science and isn't very interesting. It is misleading, intentionally.

fact_263	fact	"Just a couple of points:  First, I believe your characterization that it is the far-right that is seeking to limit third-term abortions is incorrect. There seems to be large support on these forums from both the pro-choice and the pro-life side regarding third trimester abortions. Likewise, the general public seems to have been so upset with the Supreme Courts decision in Stenburg that Congress stepped in and passed a nearly identical statute to the Nebraska law. That statute cleared the Senate with the support of 16 Democrats, and it cleared the House with the support of 63 Democrats.  That is not to ignore the fact that it is largely Republicans that would go further than third trimester restrictions. I am merely trying to point out that Roe stands in the way of restrictions that we all support (third trimester), and thus we all should hope for legal reform in this area.  Secondly, the slippery slope argument is common, and I will address it in more detail later. My basic point is that if we really do think that third trimester fetuses have a significant moral status (and I take people at their word on this), than we should work to reform abortion laws in the United States. And that reform, as I am trying to argue, must begin with the undermining of Roe v. Wade.  Note that I have not yet discussed whether Roe v. Wade should be overturned. I do plan on discussing the legal issues with this case. But as of now, I am only trying to lay some groundwork for why that discussion is so important. A lot of people that I speak with seem to think the law is so technical that it cannot be understood (or is too hard to be understood), and thus they would rather not bother with it. So, I am trying to address that. And I am doing so by simply saying ""If one seriously wishes to restrict abortion in the third trimester (which virtually everyone seems to), than one must seriously consider the legal aspects of the issue."""

fact_1820	fact	"Forwarded to me by one of my co-workers;  ""HR 45 Blair Holt Firearm Licensing & Record of Sales Act of 2009  Please send this to everybody on your list...  this is Obama gun control by secrecy.  Very Important for you to be aware of a new bill HR 45 introduced into the House.   This is the Blair Holt Firearm Licensing & Record of Sale Act of 2009.  We just learned yesterday about this on the Peter Boyles radio program.   Even gun shop owners didn't know about this because it is flying under the radar.  To find out about this - go to any government website and type in HR 45 or Google HR 45 Blair Holt Firearm Licensing & Record of Sales Act of 2009. You will get all the information.  Basically this would make it illegal to own a firearm - any rifle with a clip or ANY pistol unless:  .It is registered  .You are fingerprinted  .You supply a current Driver's License  .You supply your Social Security #  .You will submit to a physical & mental evaluation at any time of their choosing  .Each update - change or ownership through private or public sale must be reported and costs $25.  - Failure to do so you automatically lose the right to own a firearm and are subject up to a year in jail.  .There is a child provision clause on page 16 section 305 stating a child-access provision. Gun must be locked and inaccessible to any child under 18.   The Government would have the right to come and inspect that you are storing your gun safely away from accessibility to children and fine is punishable for up to 5 yrs. in prison.  If you think this is a joke - go to the website and take your pick of many options to read this...  OpenCongress - Text of H.R.45 as Introduced in House Blair Holt's Firearm Licensing and Record of Sale Act of 2009  It is long and lengthy. But, more and more people are becoming aware of this.

Also, he suggests we all join a pro-gun group like the Colorado Rifle Association, hunting associations, gun clubs and especially the NRA.  This is just a ""termite"" approach to complete confiscation of guns and disarming of our society to the point we have no defense - chip away a little here and there until the goal i s accomplished before anyone realizes it.  (Did Obama promise transparency? It seems his motives are more and more transparent while his methods are hidden in back rooms.)  This is one to act on whether you own a gun or not."""

fact_1161	fact	Well, it is interesting to not that two of the five researchers have ties to the abortion industry. One of them runs an abortion clinic; another formerly served as an attorney for NARAL. Neither researcher disclosed this information to JAMA.  This is an incidence of researcher bias entering into the scientific method. And your belief in this article takes faith.  Steve Calvin August 30, 2005 In the Minneapolis Star-Tribune  Last week's article on fetal pain in the Journal of the American Medical Association proves the desperation of the defenders of unrestricted abortion. The article reviews medical literature and concludes that fetuses are unlikely to feel pain prior to 30 weeks gestation.  The authors were clearly motivated to write what I view as a medical fantasy to counter proposed federal legislation that would limit abortion in the second trimester. The legislation would require informing women considering abortion that fetuses beyond 20 weeks feel pain and would require anesthesia for the fetus.  Twenty-five years of delivering babies and a specialization in high-risk obstetrics provide me some experience to refute the claim that fetuses feel no pain until 30 weeks. Many of the tiny babies that I deliver, some as small as 1 pound at 23 weeks, have required surgery during their difficult neonatal battle for life. All of them receive anesthesia.  Before the 1970s, many newborns, both term and preterm, were operated on without anesthesia in the mistaken belief that they could not feel pain. They certainly couldn't tell anyone about their discomfort. With more sophisticated monitoring it became clear that blood pressure and pulse rose dramatically during the trauma of surgery. Subsequently, a subspecialty of pediatric anesthesia developed.  Those who deny fetal pain claim that hormonal and withdrawal responses to invasive procedures are mere reflexes and are no evidence of pain. Recently, I performed an amniocentesis on a patient at 21 weeks gestation because of a possible infection. On ultrasound, the fetus pulled away from the needle when it grazed her arm. It is clear to me that this fetus felt discomfort, and that she would feel horrible pain if she were dismembered in the exercise of an unjust constitutional right.  The medical literature duel over abortion has been quite one-sided since most of the medical hierarchy is ardently pro-abortion. There are, however, courageous exceptions.  The most important medical study on abortion this year got absolutely no media coverage. A French study in the April 2005 British Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology convincingly showed that a previous abortion increased the risk of subsequent delivery at 22 to 27 weeks by 70 percent. Premature birth has heavy personal and societal costs, yet the alarm over the increasing rate of prematurity ignores the abortion connection.  The fight over requirements for informed consent prior to abortion continues because abortion defenders refuse to accept any restriction on this manufactured constitutional right to exercise prenatal lethal violence. Their blind orthodoxy requires denial of fetal pain and willful ignorance of the significant long-term consequences of abortion.  Steve Calvin is a Minneapolis physician.

fact_2246	fact	That crime fighting tool senario you just described is REALLY REALLY spooky. They way our justice system works is: 1) crime is commited 2) suspects are considered 3) evidence against one suspect builds and is arrested 4) suspect is given a fair trial with all the evidence present to a judge and jurry.  In our system of justice, collection of evidence is PROHIBITED by the 4th Amendment without probable cause. There is no crime, thus no exuse to collect evidence. Citizens are also protected by giving any evidence against thier will by the 5th Amendment. This collected evidence will be used against suspects without thier permission. The crime fighting tool you just described violates 2 rights in one sweep. That is a very scary power given to police.
fact_1997	fact	Well, now, here's the thing:  A hypothesis of special creation of all things (such as is described in the bible) is inconsistent with the evidence we can elicit from living things today. For instance, there's the amount of non-functional DNA we share with other creatures, in particular the other apes. With shared functional DNA, now, one could make a case for economy of design, but deliberately putting the same broken genes and garbage DNA into two entirely seperate species?  Then there's the fact that some creatures have far better 'designed' bits than others for no readily apparent reason. A good example is the octopus eye, whose retina is supplied with blood from the rear rather than the front, both anchoring the retina more securely (no detached retina problems) and avoiding the 'blind spot' mammalian eyes possess. There's no reason at all for a designer capable of making an octupus to use the inferior mammalian design.  Then there's the issue of vestigial features. Vestigial doesn't necessarily mean 'useless', more properly it describes something that is 'overengineered' for the purpose it currently serves, and often looks very much like a crippled version of a feature possessed by some other species. Ostrich wings, for example, may be useful for balancing when running, or in mating rituals, but they don't need to be wings in order to serve those purposes. Their complex and delicate internal structure is clearly 'designed' to allow flight, but their stunted development and the practical impossibility of such a big bird achieving self-powered flight make them a vestigial structure. Again, what rationale can be made for this being the work of a designer?  Then there's the fossil record. Try as one might to twist the evidence to fit a biblical flood, it just won't go. Paleontologists have found spider tracks sandwiched in sandstone layers. Imagine, if you can, the delicate impressions of a spider's footsteps surviving a deluge sufficient to suspend and deposit yards and yards of sand atop them. Hydrodynamic sorting of fossils, or burial order, doesn't fit either, since it requires that we pretend all dinosaurs were large and slow moving (they weren't) and that all mammals are small, agile and fast-moving (they aren't).  On and on it goes. If we take evolution off the table completely and look at the evidence before us, we have no explanation that fits. Special creation simply doesn't add up. With all creation myths falsified, what are we supposed to do? Just pretend the history of life on earth doesn't matter, or should be ignored?  Evolution isn't what you come up with when you apply atheist thinking. Evolution is what you come up with when you discount all the extant hypotheses that don't fit the facts, be they religiously inspired or otherwise.  Now, you may hold your hand up and complain that we're not admitting the possibility of some kind of divine guiding hand steering or helping evolution. And that's fair enough; we generally don't, for two different reasons:  First, it doesn't really add anything to the theory; it doesn't increase its power to explain what we see. So while you can of course choose to believe that's what's happening, it doesn't have any scientific value.  Secondly, there's arguably some merit in the attitude that religion has had its chance and blown it. For thousands of years religions have claimed to bear upon their backs the infallible word of god. Now, if the bible had been saying all along - centuries before the technology existed to verify it - that god coaxed organisms into evolving from simpler organisms over millions of years, that would be compelling evidence that the bible was accurate and divinely inspired, since it would contain accurate predictions (which no man could have made) about what we should find when we look into our DNA or beneath the ground. But it doesn't make those predictions. So why should we now pay attention when Intelligent Design evangelists do a 6000-year-too-late handbrake turn and invent a new faith-based explanation for the evidence? After all, they have no divine mandate to do so - it's the bible that's supposedly the word of god; they're just making stuff up as they go along.

fact_129	fact	"Really .   ""The voice of one crying in the wilderness: ""Prepare the way of the LORD; Make straight in the desert a highway for our God. (NKJV)."" Isaiah 40:3   ""In those days John the Baptist came preaching in the wilderness of Judea, and saying, 'Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand!' For this is he who was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah, saying: 'The voice of one crying in the wilderness: Prepare the way of the LORD . . . (NKJV).'"" Matt. 3:1-3   John the Baptist came before Jesus Christ and let people know that He was coming. What a fascinating period of history. This prediction was given by the prophet Isaiah, 740-680 B.C. History tell us that John the Baptist did in fact come preaching repentance and baptism.   ""But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are small among the clans of Judah, out of you will come . . . one who will be ruler over Israel, whose origins are from of old, from ancient times (NIV)."" Micah 5:2   "" After Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea, during the time of King Herod . . . (NIV)"" Matt. 2:1   Micah, 735 - 710 B.C., tells us that the Christ or Messiah will be born in Bethlehem. It is recognized by all that Jesus was indeed born in Bethlehem.   Therefore the Lord Himself will give you a sign: Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a Son, and shall call His name Immanuel (NKJV)."" Isaiah 7:14   ""Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take to you Mary your wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit. And she will bring forth a Son, and you shall call His name JESUS, for He will save His people from their sins . . . His name [is] Immanuel (NKJV)"" Matt. 1:20-23.   ""This is what the LORD says: ""A voice is heard in Ramah, mourning and great weeping, Rachel weeping for her children and refusing to be comforted, because her children are no more (NIV)."" Jer. 31:15   ""When Herod realized that he had been outwitted by the Magi, he was furious, and he gave orders to kill all the boys in Bethlehem and its vicinity who were two years old and under . . .then the [prophecy] was fulfilled (NIV)."" Matt. 2:16-4:1   Through the prophet Jeremiah, 627 - 580 B.C., God indicated that some of Israel's children would be killed at the coming of the Messiah.   ""When Israel was a child, I loved him, And out of Egypt I called My son."" Hosea 11:1   ""Now when they had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying, ""Arise, take the young Child and His mother, flee to Egypt, and stay there until I bring you word; for Herod will seek the young Child to destroy Him. When he arose, he took the young Child and His mother by night and departed for Egypt, and was there until the death of Herod, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying, ""Out of Egypt I called My Son."" (NKJV).'"" Matt. 2:13-15   This prophecy was given by the prophet Hosea around 750 B.C. This amazing prophecy says that Messiah would come from Egypt. Jesus had to be born into the family of David, born of a virgin, born in Bethlehem, children would die and Jesus come out of Egypt. The prophet must have wondered why Messiah would come out of Egypt. This did not fit the concept the Jews had about Messiah. This is God's plan and these are God's prophecies.   ""They divide my garments among them, and for my clothing they cast lots (NKJV)."" Ps. 22:18   ""Then they crucified Him, and divided His garments, casting lots, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet: ""They divided My garments among them, And for My clothing they cast lots (NKJV)."" Matt. 27:35   After the soldiers crucified Jesus (nailed Him to the cross), they gambled for Jesus' clothes. Little did they know they were fulfilling a 1000 years old prophecy. The prediction was provided by God through King David.   ""I will pour on the house of David and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem the Spirit of grace and supplication; then they will look on Me whom they pierced (NKJV)."" Zech. 12:10   ""But one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and immediately blood and water came out.  For these things [occurred] that the Scripture should be fulfilled . . . ""They shall look on Him whom they pierced (NKJV)."" John 19:34-37   Another isolated event predicted in 520-512 B.C. In A.D. 33, some soldier thrust his spear into the side of Jesus to make sure that He would die before 6 pm that evening. Little did he realize that Jesus was already dead (John 19:30) and that he was fulfilling a 480 year old prophecy from Zechariah.   ""Even my own familiar friend in whom I trusted, who ate my bread, has lifted up His heel against me (NKJV)."" Ps. 41:9   ""Judas Iscariot . . . betrayed Him."" Matt. 10:4  ""that the scripture might be fulfilled, 'He who eats My bread has lifted up his heel against Me (NKJV)."" John 13:21-28   This prediction was recorded by King David, 1020 - 970 B.C. It refers to the Messiah's betrayal by His friends. Judas is well known as the one who agreed to help the Romans capture Jesus at a cost of 30 pieces of silver. Peter was another who betrayed Jesus three times.   ""See, your king comes to you, righteous and having salvation, gentle and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey (NIV)."" Zech 9:9   ""And the disciples . . . brought the donkey and the colt, and laid on them garments, on which he sat. And most of the multitude spread their garments in the road, and others were cutting branches from the trees and spreading them in the road (NIV)."" Matt. 21:6-8   Zechariah, 480 - 470 B.C., stated that Messiah, the king, would come riding on a donkey. Donkeys were sometimes ridden in times of peace (Judges 5:10) but stallions were normally used by kings. This is unexpected by those looking for a military Messiah.   If you want more just ask."

fact_115	fact	Again, I did not say that they did not recommend abortion... they do offer it as an option, but I have never heard of anyone being 'forced' to have one by Planned Parenthood. All I was disputing was when you said that they ALWAYS recommended it. They do offer pregnancy counseling, along with pregnancy testing. They also offer birth control, gynecological care, STD testing, infertility testing, sexual education counseling, prenatal care, adoption referrals.. etc...Almost all of these things are offered by my regular doctor, and probably most other doctors as well. They don't have a maternity ward at Planned Parenthood because they aren't a hospital, and you can go to your own hospital to have an ultrasound done, but if a clinic does an abortion themselves, they have to do an ultrasound first, to determine how far along the pregnancy is, because there are different procedures for different amounts of weeks. If an ob/gyn sees an ultrasound with severe problems, they will sometimes recommend an abortion too.  All in all, I just thought that your remark that Planned Parenthood always recommended an abortion was wrong. They also offer services to men too, do you think they recommend abortion to them as well??  I have nothing wrong with you being pro-life... I honestly don't. I think it's good that you stand up for what you believe in. But when you make a statement on how a woman is wrong to have an abortion even if her own life is in danger, I find that a little ignorant. I'm not saying that you are ignorant yourself, but I don't think you are as well informed on everything as you seem to think you are.  And can I ask, are you male? If you are, you will never, ever be in any type of situation like that, so how can you decide what a woman should do when SHE is faced with a situation?
fact_101	fact	As proved above by definition of reason above, it all depends on what premise or starting assumption you have as to what conclusion you will reason out. You are correct that faith does not neccessary require evidence. But there is usually always evidence to support the validity of a particular faith, in this case Christianity.
fact_2087	fact	"Can you read? You linked to a site that is essentially a bibliography. The title is ""Feminism AND Science."" Did you intend to mislead?"
fact_667	fact	"How elegant. Yes science is the way to understanding the physical world, and faith is the manifestation of our spiritual selves. But when you say this among sci-only people, it is immediately misconstrued. Most sci people won't even read that sentence objectively. Say the word ""spirit"" and suddenly you are changed into a fundamentalist, inbred, uneducated, dimwit who wouldn't know Planck's constant if it hit you in the head.  Life is much more than a series of reactions. It is cool that we are able to reduce it down so much. The benefits of science are vast. But there just seems that there is more than meets the eye. I'm curious."
fact_1565	fact	The dead ones can't, and things like Cystic Fibrosis or Severe Combined Immunodeficiency are going to kill you easily before you reach sexual maturity without medical care.   Genetic disease - kills people - dead people don't have babies  The rest of natural selection fits in as lesser versions of that, healthy animals have more children and more of those survive. Hungry and unhealthy ones are going to have fewer, and likely fewer healthy ones. The cycle continues.
fact_854	fact	Damn, your links sure show a lack of knowledge. Do you have any sources that aren't ignorant as all heck?  While Hoyle came up with the term 'the big bang', he was mocking it. Hoyle was a proponent of the Steady State concept of the universe, which he held on to long after it was disproved by empirical evidence.  FFS, if you are going to use a source, have one that at least has the history of the theory right?   Yes, the estimated age of the universe changed over time. We got increasingly more sophisticated ways to measure it. In the last 30 years, the age estimate has not significantly changed, but the +/- has narrowed drastically. Do try to use a source that isn't over 30 years old.

fact_1575	fact	(Sorry to hear you lost an hour's worth of work... I hate it when that happens!)  I may not have made this clear, but here are the facts:  1) A unique human entity comes into existence at the point of conception/fertilization. It is pointless to argue this fact, because the evidence to suggest that this is true is insurmountable. The zygote/blastocyst/embryo/fetus/neonate/baby/child (whichever label you choose) is a member of the species homo sapiens sapiens. Period.  2) Just because something is human does not necessarily make it a 'human being' or a 'person.' These are not scientific terms. It is impossible to 'prove' that a pre-birth human entity is a 'human being' under all possible interpretations of a 'human being.' The argument could be made, for example, that a 'being' must have some sort of self-awareness. It would be quite difficult to find evidence that suggests that a developing human blastocyst has any self-awareness.  So, to answer your question, regardless of what anyone believes, a post-conception entity formed from a human sperm and a human ovum is a unique human entity from that point on.  My question to you: What do you consider to be the reason the pre-birth baby is a 'human being' that deserves 'personhood' according to the law?
fact_844	fact	So you see, Brady, you're wrong again. The McDonald ruling wasn't an issue of guaranteeing white men their ability to feel safe in the face of growing minority groups. Quite the opposite. The McDonald ruling was about striking against those with racist and evil intentions who would use the law to render innocent people helpless for no good reason. It was as much about protecting minorities from harm as anything.

Similarly, I cannot prove the existence of a Flying Shoe in Hyperspace, nor can I disprove it, but I can prove that the Flying Shoe does not exist in our world because it exists, by definition, in Hyperspace.  I can make up anything I want and say it exists in another universe. A round square, a colorless green idea that sleeps furiously, you name it.

fact_1561	fact	"I don't know about capuchins, and I am not going to a website. However, I have read just about everything Jane Goodall has written, and I do not see chimps as being ""just"". They willing hunt down old friends and kill them ( or help to kill them). In the Passion (name of a chimp - Jane named hers) case, the female monkey deliberately found other female members of her own tribe when they were alone and too far away for the others to hear cries of help, and with the help of her children ripped the babies from their mothers and proceded to eat them in front of the mothers. Then as if they had done nothing wrong they would go up and touch the mother ""lovingly"".Some people can say these show human traits (Jane does), however, while it is common for animals to kill and feel no remorse for it, many humans feel horrible remorse even if they were not directly responsible for killing another human. Some even feel remorse for killing animals. Whether you agree they are human traits or not, you must agree that most humans have some sense of justice. I do not see that sense of justice in all of Jane's research."

fact_878	fact	Yes, I know what it is. I also know of mothers who have never breast-fed.  Are you trying to imply that, because a baby is sometimes breast-fed, it retains a biological connection to the mother similar to the umbilical cord? I'd call that stretching the boundaries of 'biological connection', personally...  Before birth, if the mother dies, the foetus dies (with one noticable exception that I know of). After birth, this is no longer the case.
fact_2054	fact	Not in this instance, no. It isnât trying to parallel pregnancy per se(though it is most relevant for us if we take it as only 9 months), but trying to parallel the moral scenario of having a person attached to you against your will and without your consent. If the pro-life mantra is to be believed, it is never correct to disconnect someone if they will die if you do. So, the argument is applicable for 9 days, 9 months, 9 years or forever.
fact_887	fact	Sport, if life-forms - including bacteria - are 'intelligent and dynamic', why does genetic engineering work? Why don't these 'intelligent and dynamic' bacteria reject or ignore the foreign DNA and go on working as before?

The first birds, as far as we can tell from the fossil evidence, were gliders so probably spent time in the trees. Small, agile, gliding dinosaurs could exploit an previously unoccupied niche.

fact_677	fact	"Color is a function of the wavelength of light. Thus, quantum considerations aside, there are a nigh infinite number of colors. Humans, of course, can only see a subset of those colors, ranging from about 400 to 700 nanometers. In particular, our eyes have cells ""tuned"" to three ranges of wavelengths; blue, red, and green. You could think of those as short, medium, and long wavelengths. By extrapolating from the relativity intensities from the particular cells we can ""figure out"" what wavelength is entering our eyes.  http://www.cambridgeincolour.com/tut...perception.htm  Does this dispell your confusion?  Edit:  And just to address one other point, scientists are well aware of the limitations of the human eye. That's why, when exact determination of color is important, machines that can read precise wavelengths are used, rather than relying on the known to be limited instrument which is the human eye."
fact_1011	fact	To expound on my last post:  And yet this is taken to be fact unanimously in our history books. Funny how easy this book gets a pass. If we think it's Homer then for this book, that's good enough. But not so with the Bible. There can be absolutely no kernel of uncertainty, which in ancient texts, ambiguity is unavoidable.  In regards to who wrote these books, the best evidence we have leads to Homer. Therefore, we decide it is almost certainly Homer who is the author. This is undisputed.  However, in regards to the Bible, skeptics overturn the use of Occam's Razor and require more than adequate proof of the Bible's claims. Even though the Bible is the most heavily documented writing of its day, still skeptics require more in order to believe the Gospels are actually true.  Double standard much?

Furthermore, you are saying mental existence is not solely the thing that gives you value but rather it depends on outside influences and chance.  At some point it just seems like the stance on abortion is that the woman is more important no matter what. This is why I claim some will rank humans above other humans...a dangerous precedent which we have tried before."
fact_1005	fact	"So, any creationist want to tell us why these people are so wrong?  Is the international committee a sign of a conspiracy?  Are they trying to hide the fact that radiometric dating techniques don't work?  Is there really a strong causal relationship between the environmental changes recorded in the rocks and the fossils found there?  Is there really ""missing time"" or was the 85 million years of the Ediacaran Period really contained in 100m of rock?  Is atmospheric oxygen a result of tectonic forces?

fact_449	fact	"That I have failed to prove it at all is only according to the atheist worldview. A neutral, agnostic worldview may think they are somewhat comparable. The Judeo Christian worldview that is taught to many students by their parents would think that evolution (happenstance origins) isn't in any way close to ID. So we have two one sided worldviews, and one neutral one. Since a free exploration of ideas would give students the most complete picture, would interfere less with altering their worldviews that were most likely formed in the home, and would be most likely to teach them HOW to think, why are we dangerously close (thanks John Jones) to allowing one - one sided worldview to completely suppress another worldview in the science classroom? The answer of course, is politics. Science has become more and more politicized as the domestic federal government grows larger and larger. The government that once had limited powers has become more and more discoverers of emergencies and crisies, that entitle us all, particularly organizations, to a share of federal pie. Science has gladly hopped on board - they have the measuring devices, the microscopes and telescopes.   In 1989, the budget of the National Institutes of Health was $7.9 billion. In 2005 it's $28.8 billion. This is one of many government agencies that science ""serves"", and others have fat budgets as well. Leaf through Science magazine and you'll see that the maintanance of government spending on science is one of it's biggest preoccupations. To maintain it, science peddles hope and fear. Of course, some say that religion peddles the same thing. Science would rather not compete with it, and it certainly doesn't help when the new concept of ID, armed with the latest scientific discoveries, comes along questioning established scientific ""theories"" that keep them at the highest rung of the hope and fear ladder.  It used to be that religion and science didn't compete, and they shouldn't today. But they do, and there's only one difference from yesterday and today - government money."
fact_1978	fact	Actually, selection occurs by differential reproductive rates. What this means is that organisms which reproduce more will have more offspring than the others (obviously). Therefore, traits that help organisms reproduce will become more prevailant.
fact_307	fact	Your assumption that the parents are less mature than the child is equally as ludicrous as your claim that a 14 year old is mature enough to make this decision before she is old enough to sign ANY LEGALLY BINDING CONTRACT, and that includes 15, 16 and 17 year olds. They are still below the age of consent so the issue should be moot.   But unfortunately, in this day and age when parents are becoming more like caretakers rather than moral guides, it is only a matter of time before they lose all authority over their child's decisions to the State.
fact_2281	fact	"And this ladies and gentleman is the problem: ""SheriG"" and other creationists swallow myths and lies and never question them, for they reject the search for knowledge in favour of the security of mythology. ""99.9%"" of learned people around Columbus' time knew the world was a sphere and had done so for 2,000 years at least! The idea that people thought the world flat at the time is a myth. Try:  http://nabataea.net/flatearth.html  http://www.bede.org.uk/flatearth.htm  http://www.christiananswers.net/q-aig/aig-c034.html  They are from a variety of sources, even including a creationist one at the end. Oh and no surprise that the very first line of that last site is a lie, as that is standard practice of creation websites. ""Evolutionists often falsely accuse creationists of believing in a flat Earth"" is untrue: we simply liken them to flat-Earthers because of the same assinine refusal to accept reality."
fact_461	fact	"Let's give credit where credit is due. Science taught that the world was the centre of the universe. The leading scientists convinced churchmen to take allegorical passages of the Bible and re-interpret them as literal. The ancient Greeks, who were esteemed in Europe as the pre-eminent scientists of their day believed this.  They also believed that people were made up of four elements. And taught this.  Scientists backed up racism  ""No rational man (writes Thomas Huxley, a contemporary evolutionist), cognizant of the facts, believes that the average Negro is the equal, still less the superior, of the white man. And if this be true, it is simply incredible that, when all his disabilities are removed, and our prognathous relative has a fair field and no favor, as well as no oppressor, he will be able to compete successfully with his bigger-brained and smaller-jawed rival, in a contest which is to be carried out on by thoughts and not by bites.""

fact_2336	fact	I think this is pointing out that an organism doesn't start as naked DNA, its within a cell that has split off from another organism (possibly developing inside it even) which is being exposed to triggers from the environment. So far this is fitting with your view of evolution.  The bit where you seem to get confused is to then think what are the triggers acting on? Is the information that encodes the changes in the environment or within the genes - clearly if you put various organisms into an environment they do not all change the same way. The fish that get larger in the absence of predators are clearly going to react in the opposite way to the predators themselves.  The key to the idea here is that they are triggers - things which then cause other things to create the effect we see. Genes are turned on, off or have the amount of expression altered by external effects, Bacteria have whole sets of genes that are generally switched off until the situation triggers them. Does this mean the bacteria have suddenly learned how to produce some essential amino acid, due to the innate property of an amino acid lacking environment, or that the environment has triggered a change in the expression of genes and causing something to happen that wasn't happening before?

All of these margins were well above the percentage of votes cast for Bush and Kerry, respectively. Ohio, for instance, went to Bush by 2%, but the ban was passed by 24%. Bush lost Oregon by 4%, but the ban passed by 14%. Bush lost Michigan by 3%, but the ban passed by 18%. The margin of victory for each of these states exceeds George Bush's margin of victory in that state. Those extra votes had to come from somewhere, and it seems like many people other than the ""religious right"" feel the same way."
fact_273	fact	False. Beneficial mutations in bacteria have been observed in the lab. Far from wrecking the system, they allowed the system to continue to live while those without the mutations died: the mutations improved the system's ability to survive and perpetuate itself.
fact_1824	fact	The concept that science no longer looks at animals boggles my mind. My brother is a wildlife biology major in college meaning his primary focus is......looking at animals and their relationships to one another. It is somewhat understandable that your misconception could arise because molecular biology and genetic engineering are the latest crazes in science. The simple fact is most of the big breakthroughs when studying whole animals have been made. A similar turn has occured in chemistry. I could argue that chemists have subtly turned away from chemical reactions. All the research now is about electron orbitals and nano-structures. The reason for this is these are new fields that are relatively young and many scientists are interested in them. I myself am doing research on buckminster fullerenes. It doesn't mean we've abandoned good old fashioned reactions, we just have more field to play in now.
fact_515	fact	But you are the accuser. I've read the Bible and I have studied religion, more than you can imagine. I have also studied biology, performed experiments and reached conclusions. The problem is that you seem unable to think for yourself.

I noticed Brady refered to the KKK as a mob, I get the picture Brady thinks that if gun owners gather for whatever the reason, that we are mobs as well, but when his side gathers they are an organization. And no Brady, I dont belong to or associate with hate groups.

fact_1367	fact	EXTREME minority. Pandions ascertations are rediculous.   In the end, the decision will be made based on the accuracy of the proposal, nothing else.  Back in 1999 when they removed macro evolution from the curriculum requirements, they did so because their science advisory board, a board composed of college professors from our state colleges, including a couple of folks who are cinsidered some fo the top biologists in the world, told them unanimously that while macro evolution was the best theory we currently have, it may be wrong. Apparently while there is a huge amount of data and emprical evidence to support micro evolution, the same body of evidence does not necessarily prove macro evolution.  Panion is simply a zealot on the other side of the issue from the YEC folks. He/She sees gloom and doom for anybody that dares approach the theory. This kind of thinking is what sets us back to the middle ages. If we do not present the holes and weak spots in the theory, how are they ever going to be filled?

However, there are no doubt cases in the history of the world (not just within America) where there were no options available to a mother but to keep her child (ie: the first human woman to give birth in the history of the world). For this pro-choice line of reasoning to be absoulutely true it must be true in every possible situation. Are you saying that the killing would be justified if no other options were available to her?
fact_1415	fact	**  As above, 'social classes' are 'populations', and modern darwinian evolution focuses entirely on the 'evolution' of 'populations', NOT individual organisms. Neo-Lamarkian theory focuses on individual, internally driven effort, instead of inherited advantage, which is the be-all and end-all of Darwinism, and of modern economic and political social theory.

The entire specious claim that there are pygostylian Avialae which pre-date Archaeopteryx lithographica stems from Chatterjee's most dubious fossil, ""Protoavis texensis,"" and Confuciusornis sanctus, which was initially described as dating from Tithonian horizons of the terminal Jurassic--although subsequently Hou et al (1996) presented more conclusive evidence placing the confuciusornid material from the Barremian (much to the chagrin of Alan Feduccia, who made much of Confuciusornis being from the Jurassic). As for ""Protoavis,"" the holotype and paratype are almost certainly composed of material which is not conspecific, and the material seems to correspond to a coelophysoid/drepanosaur chimera (Paul 2002), or a coelophysoid chimera (Gauthier & Rowe 1990).   As for the Eichstatt Conference. It hardly concluded that Archaeotperyx was a ""true bird,"" it concluded that as opposed to the hypotheses of some (e.g., Thulborn 1976), Archaeopteryx was indeed the most basal avialian, and not a less derived member of Coelurosauria. One would actually suggest referring to the published data from the conference, in Hecht et al 1985, before continuing to make such assertions.  Vindex Urvogel"
fact_918	fact	in defense of the fruit fly, why would one evolve when one is already suited well to their environment? what good does a 7th leg do?  and about the experiment itself - please, ALWAYS post references. who did the experiment? when? under what conditions? how? assuming you were correct about the experiment, were variables put in place such as habitat changes to reflect the timeline you speak of, a large variety of fruit flies to begin with, random mating, etc etc or did some people just shoot some x rays at a couple fruit flies, did some arithmetic which was probably wrong and called it that?  and im sorry, but there is mountains of direct evidence for evolution, you just need to go and look at it.

The more you push you agenda through activist judges, the closer you get to the people having to pass an amendment. At least New York was smart enough not to do it right before an election.

fact_703	fact	The gene and therefore the enzyme it produces. LPL is the designation for a gene that encodes Lipoprotein Lipase, an enzyme that hydrolyzes lipids in lipoproteins. The actual gene encodes a protein of 475 amino acids that becomes a mature protein of 448 amino acids after cleavage of a signal peptide. One study was able to identify 3 common SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) in the coding region of the gene, 2 of which result in small changes in enzyme function in European populations. The third SNP converts that locus to a stop codon and results in an enzyme that is 447 amino acids long. Thus, the enzyme has been truncated. The resulting enzyme, LPL S447X, is functional. In fact, it results in lower incidence of vascular disease and lower blood pressure. Other truncations result in non-functional enzymes.

fact_1825	fact	"I was unaware that chocked full and non-existant were synonomous,learn something new everyday.  I agree , who would believe in dino to birds after reading this , an idiot? Wrong answer , an evolutionist would. I guess those are synonyms as well.  Just so you can't say I took it out of context here is Dr. Olsen's letter in it's entirety.  National Museum of Natural History   Smithsonian Institution   Washington, D. C. 20560   1 November 1999   OPEN LETTER TO:   Dr. Peter Raven, Secretary   PRaven@nas.org   Committee for Research and Exploration   National Geographic Society   Washington, DC 20036   Dear Peter,   I thought that I should address to you the concerns expressed below because your committee is at least partly involved and because you are certainly now the most prominent scientist at the National Geographic Society.   With the publication of ""Feathers for T. rex?"" by Christopher P. Sloan in its November issue, National Geographic has reached an all-time low for engaging in sensationalistic, unsubstantiated, tabloid journalism. But at the same time the magazine may now claim to have taken its place in formal taxonomic literature.   Although it is possible that Mr. Czerkas ""will later name"" the specimen identified on page 100 as Archaeoraptor liaoningensis, there is no longer any need for him to do so.   Because this Latinized binomial has apparently not been published previously and has now appeared with a full-spread photograph of the specimen ""accompanied by a description or definition that states in words characters that are purported to differentiate the taxon,"" the name Archaeoraptor liaoningensis Sloan is now available for purposes of zoological nomenclature as of its appearance in National Geographic (International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, Article 13a, i). This is the worst nightmare of many zoologists---that their chance to name a new organism will be inadvertently scooped by some witless journalist. Clearly, National Geographic is not receiving competent consultation in certain scientific matters.   Sloan's article explicitly states that the specimen in question is known to have been illegally exported and that ""the Czerkases now plan to return it to China."" In Washington, in June of 1996, more than forty participants at the 4th International Meeting of the Society of Avian Paleontology and Evolution, held at the Smithsonian Institution, were signatories to a letter to the Director of the Chinese Academy of Sciences that deplored the illegal trade in fossils from China and encouraged the Chinese government to take further action to curb this exploitation.   There were a few fossil dealers at that meeting and they certainly got the message. Thus, at least since mid-1996 it can hardly have been a secret to anyone in the scientific community or the commercial fossil business that fossils from Liaoning offered for sale outside of China are contraband.   Most, if not all, major natural history museums in the United States have policies in effect that prohibit their staff from accepting any specimens that were not legally collected and exported from the country of origin. The National Geographic Society has not only supported research on such material, but has sensationalized, and is now exhibiting, an admittedly illicit specimen that would have been morally, administratively, and perhaps legally, off-limits to researchers in reputable scientific institutions.   Prior to the publication of the article ""Dinosaurs Take Wing"" in the July 1998 National Geographic, Lou Mazzatenta, the photographer for Sloan's article, invited me to the National Geographic Society to review his photographs of Chinese fossils and to comment on the slant being given to the story. At that time, I tried to interject the fact that strongly supported alternative viewpoints existed to what National Geographic intended to present, but it eventually became clear to me that National Geographic was not interested in anything other than the prevailing dogma that birds evolved from dinosaurs.   Sloan's article takes the prejudice to an entirely new level and consists in large part of unverifiable or undocumented information that ""makes"" the news rather than reporting it. His bald statement that ""we can now say that birds are theropods just as confidently as we say that humans are mammals"" is not even suggested as reflecting the views of a particular scientist or group of scientists, so that it figures as little more than editorial propagandizing. This melodramatic assertion had already been disproven by recent studies of embryology and comparative morphology, which, of course, are never mentioned.   More importantly, however, none of the structures illustrated in Sloan's article that are claimed to be feathers have actually been proven to be feathers. Saying that they are is little more than wishful thinking that has been presented as fact. The statement on page 103 that ""hollow, hairlike structures characterize protofeathers"" is nonsense considering that protofeathers exist only as a theoretical construct, so that the internal structure of one is even more hypothetical.   The hype about feathered dinosaurs in the exhibit currently on display at the National Geographic Society is even worse, and makes the spurious claim that there is strong evidence that a wide variety of carnivorous dinosaurs had feathers. A model of the undisputed dinosaur Deinonychus and illustrations of baby tyrannosaurs are shown clad in feathers, all of which is simply imaginary and has no place outside of science fiction.   The idea of feathered dinosaurs and the theropod origin of birds is being actively promulgated by a cadre of zealous scientists acting in concert with certain editors at Nature and National Geographic who themselves have become outspoken and highly biased proselytizers of the faith. Truth and careful scientific weighing of evidence have been among the first casualties in their program, which is now fast becoming one of the grander scientific hoaxes of our age---the paleontological equivalent of cold fusion. If Sloan's article is not the crescendo of this fantasia, it is difficult to imagine to what heights it can next be taken. But it is certain that when the folly has run its course and has been fully exposed, National Geographic will unfortunately play a prominent but unenviable role in the book that summarizes the whole sorry episode.   Sincerely,   Storrs L. Olson   Curator of Birds   National Museum of Natural History   Smithsonian Institution   Washington, DC 20560   Ph. 202-357-33212   FAX 1-202-633-8084   email: olson.storrs@nmnh.si.edu   Why don't you write Dr. Olson and ask him if this is true ?"

fact_1170	fact	"This was pretty much my understanding of how natural selection was viewed before Darwin.  Nonetheless, I think that my point still stands. Darwin proposed that natural selection is responsible for the diversification of species. This pre-Darwin concept denies this. My understanding is that anti-evolutionists refused to accept that natural selection could have led to the diversification of species. Until recently, when they realized that evolutionary theory could help out in their how-many-animals-could-fit-on-the-ark dilemma; now they suddenly take an idea from evolutionary science and propose that suddenly all the present species could ""micro-evolve"" from a few ancestral ""kinds"" on the ark."
fact_1164	fact	"Actually its one of the oldest gun laws on the books.  The Sullivan Act, also known as the Sullivan Law, is a controversial gun control law in New York State. Upon first passage, the Sullivan Act required licenses for New Yorkers to possess firearms small enough to be concealed. Possession of such firearms without a license was a misdemeanor, carrying them was a felony. The possession or carrying of weapons such as brass knuckles, sandbags, blackjacks, bludgeons or bombs was a felony, as was possessing or carrying a dagger, ""dangerous knife"" or razor ""with intent to use the same unlawfully"". Named for its primary legislative sponsor, state senator Timothy Sullivan, a notoriously corrupt Tammany Hall politician, it dates to 1911, and is still in force, making it one of the older existing gun control laws in the United States.  Many believe the act was to discriminate against immigrants in New York, particularly Italians, as the first person arrested under the law was mobster Giuseppe Costabile. Whether this was part of the law's intent, it was passed on a wave of anti-immigrant rhetoric as a measure to disarm an alleged criminal element. The police granted the licenses, and could easily discriminate against ""undesirable"" elements. Sponsor ""Big Tim"" Sullivan reputedly desired the law so that his criminal cohorts could go about their activities unimpeded by citizens defending themselves with concealed handguns. It was used against political enemies by dropping a small pistol into an overcoat pocket. Thus having them arrested and put in jail for violation. Big Tim stepped in front of a speeding subway train."

fact_2280	fact	Yes, that's all true, and it makes complete sense. But in doing this, the Court may have created a situation where plaintiffs can argue that California is denying people the equal protection of the laws, by allowing some people to be married to same-sex spouses and not allowing other people to be so married. If that is the argument that the plaintiffs make in their federal lawsuit, this could be interesting. The courts might have to interpret whether allowing some people to be married and not allowing other people to be married violates the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment to the U.S. constitution. And then they might have to decide whether this means that all same-sex couples must have the right to marry, because some of them can be legally married. In other words, this situation may be an opportunity, because no one can argue that this is a case of apples and oranges of same-sex couples being different from opposite-sex couples. Now you have same-sex couples who are legally married and same-sex couples who cannot be legally married in the same state, which can be argued to be denial of equal protection of the laws. I don't know....it could be interesting. Maybe things won't play out this way. We'll have to wait and see.

fact_1762	fact	But the civil war wasn't fought for slavery. If you will recall the average northern soldier wasn't too fond of blacks, and that is not only sugar coating it, but saying it in the nicest terms possible. The civil war was fought to keep the union in tact. Border states still kept their slaves for obvious reasons, the intactness of the union trumped any moral principal. Besides, that wasn't true even in practice. Black soldiers were paid less, had less equipment, had less medical care and were given the worst jobs possible. Hardly created equal. It took some time before they could even fight. Your argument is a load of garbage to someone who actually has knownledge about the civil war.   I won't even go into the reconstruction period and how your so called principal didn't even exist.
fact_1004	fact	"Darwin spent 20 years after his voyage on the Beagle piling on the evidence for his theory and developing it further before the first Origin publication. He took hundreds of samples of birds from different parts of the world as evidence. He was an avid insect collector - he used those to support his theory. He conducted experiments in his greenhouse. Fossils displayed at the London Natural History Museum were used as evidence for his theory. THAT is how one collects evidence for a theory, not by just inferring that animals and plants are here, so they must have had a designer. There has not been a single piece of evidence for ID that I am aware of - from what I've seen, supporters of ID merely attempt to debunk Darwin's theory - hardly evidence.  ID advocates use the eye as evidence for something that's so complex that it couldn't have evolved. In fact, we have a very good idea of how the eye evolved, we can not only see it happen among fetus', but there are plenty of animals alive today that have inferior or primative eyes. Again, this is not evidence for ID, saying 'The eye is complicated, God must have done it"".  Have you ever read the first edition of Origin of Species? It's completely semantic free. You dont even need to know anything about science or biology to understand it.  And I rarely hear evolutionists use terms like ""designed for"". It's much more terms such as ""evolved for"" or ""adapted to fit"". But even so, nature has blindly designed organisms to better suit their environment, so terminology in this case matters not."
fact_1010	fact	"And it doesn't stop there. Another of my favorites is how they loudly criticize radiometric dating (most commonly radiocarbon dating because they know no other kind) then shout from the rooftops that radiometric dating confirms the ""genuineness"" of ~2000 year old manuscripts..."

If anyone actually studies the civil rights movement they will plainly see that it was the southern democrats who plunged us first into the civil war under Lincoln's administration by attempting succession rather than freeing the slaves, and it was the DEMOCRATS IN CONGRESS who fought civil rights legislation right up to the 60s before finally passing a weaker bill than was submitted by a Republican at the time. Al Gore Senior was one of the loudest opposers of civil rights. And was George Wallace and Governor Patterson, Governors who refused to honor or enforce equal rights after passage, Republicans or a Democrats? For you children from Rio Linda, they were Democrats. They fought desegregation at every level of the process.

fact_879	fact	"if God, even a non-biblical God, existed, then would you say that he would have always existed? wouldnt this God be the same and consistent throughout eternity? so far, we agree that the existence of a documented/biblical God cannot be proven. an undocumented/non-biblical God has never even been encountered, not even in the last 5000 years when the other Gods were being written about. if this God had the ability to make himself known at his perogative, why would he not do so until now? and if he doesnt show himself/make his existence known now why would he wait until later? we could extrapolate this forever, and this undocumented/non-biblical God would never ""choose to"" manifest. therefore, the existence of such a God can never be proven  the same applies for 3. if such a God never ""decides to"" manifest his presence, then even if he exists it would be of absolutely no consequence to mankind at all"

fact_1206	fact	"Almost all did. In fact, probably all that you are aware of did. Even the energy in the steak that you eat came from the sun ultimately. The thing is that evolution seems to have resulted in an organism to take advantage of almost every form of available energy. And what energy is left by ""higher"" animals is used by others - insects, microbes - until there is little usable energy left. That even goes so far that there are some organisms that get their energy from geothermal sources - no light involved."

By the fact of their being alive (which is in fact the ""life-struggle"") they acquire (as a population) mutations. Some of those mutations aid them in their ""life-struggle"" and thus become more likely to appear in the succeeding generation. Thus the succeeding generations have a slightly different memory of the past than their predecessors. And thats that; the author clearly does not grasp the means by which complexity emerges in biological systems. Once more Adami is applicable here. And I have to add that the mechanisms of mutation, selection, and inheritance are well established at the molecular level, at the micro-cytological level, at the nuclear level, at the cellular level, at the organisimal level, and at the population and ecological levels. EAMs only riposte to that large empirical base is - to invoke mysterious and unknown and undemonstrated mechanisms which have no basis in fact.

fact_689	fact	"That's NOT the equivalent of ID - you're mixing causes & effects.

Students shouldn't have it implied to them that happenstance origins are the only possible cause of gravitational behavior. Your ""apple falling"" scenario is a simple one - the original cause of gravity has practically no impact on how we observe and deal with it's effects. Other scientific subjects aren't that simple."

fact_845	fact	Nobody but you has suggested that the schools are out any money except for you, and you have presented no evidence whatsoever that they are. You ignore the LIKELY scenarios and immediately jump to an extremely UNLIKELY one that fits your agenda...that they used school facilities without paying for them.  Our local school district rents out school buses to groups and rents building facilities out for events all the time. It is smart....they have the resources on hand and it provides a little extra money for the district. Granted that explanation does not fit your agenda, and it would be much easier for you to make your point if we all ignored the most LIKELY solution and instead accepted your EXTREMELY UNLIKELY solution at face value, but you cant actually expect people with any intelligence at all to do that.   As far as the cops go....have you ever seen a protest where there were NOT cops on hand? I certainly never have. Even when Fred Phelps and his little band of sickos protests a funeral, the police are there to make sure that nobody starts handing out beat downs. One of the beautiful things about America is that you have the right to protest, and the police have a responsibility to protect you while you do it. The idea that the DC police would not have protected the BOA executive is another completely unsupported assumption put forth here and to some degree by the author of the article and frankly it is a particularly ignorant one. The author of the article contends that if the protesters had decided to burn the guys house there is nothing the DC police could have done to stop it since they were outside their jurisdiction AFTER they talk about the fact that there is a cross jurisdictional agreement in place. Frankly you would have to have the intelligence of a house plant to follow that line of reasoning.  Your take on this entire thing is ridiculous and unamerican. There is no evidence whatsoever that anything improper took place here. What happened is that a bunch of protesters who were careful not to break the law went and told a guy that he is a huge XXXXX. The DC PD sent 2 units to ensure that nobody was hurt during the course of the protest. The local police also sent units in response to calls from neighbors. The local police stayed until the end, but no arrests were made because, as they noted in their statement, the protesters were careful not to break any laws.   I believe that you, sir, are little more than a partisan hack bending reality to fit your agenda.

fact_1562	fact	"So what. Congress can pass any law it wants. Doesn't mean it will stand up in court.  The first portion, ""A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State,"" is a qualifier to what follows ""the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed."" It seems pretty clear to me. But I'm not one of the Justices. This decision has been made, although I don't like it or agree with it. I don't see where today's hobbyist meets the intent - most especially in the well-regulated part. But there comes a point where what the dead guys thought just doesn't matter that much. It is 200+ years later. They left us with the ability to adjust with time and we've done that. They recognized their own shortcomings which might have the the wisest thing they did. The current interpretation is clear. We look at the last portion of the statement only. I don't think that, as I said before, a little common sense, is going to alter the interpretation in any meaningful way.  After all, I could easily argue (if I was totally stupid) that my front yard is the perfect place for a working cannon. We both know that isn't going to fly. Just where does the armament argument end. With a cannon? Or with a Nuc. Let's face it. They said arms and they meant arms. Not guns. They'd probably let me have the cannon. The founding fathers never envisioned the kind of weapons we'd have available today or what they'd be used for. That's why their thoughts are purposely criptic and open ended. Since we will always draw the line someplace, why not draw it at a good compromise between you and me."
fact_853	fact	"Well that's true under one condition: that there is such thing as a random mutation that creates a new, beneficial body part or function. I'm not sure this has ever been established as fact. (How does science go about proving randomness in a mutation, anyway?...it seems to me that one must accept that mutations are random by faith.)  ""It is our contention that if ârandomâ is given a serious and crucial interpretation from a probabilistic point of view, the randomness postulate is highly implausible and that an adequate scientific theory of evolution must await the discovery and elucidation of new natural laws.""â*Murray Eden, ""Inadequacies of Neo-Darwinian Evolution as Scientific Theory,"" in Mathematical Challenges to the Neo-Darwinian Theory of Evolution (1967), p. 109.  This still means a population containing a range of variants that natural selection can act on, preserving some epigenetic alterations as opposed to others.  but if the variation is nonrandom, it doesn't matter: selection's role, like I said above, would be doing nothing more than eliminating the weaklings. According to ToE, selection is a creative force of evolution, guiding the direction of evolution.  Gould:  The central logic of Darwinism requires that natural selection not merely operate, but that it be the creative force of evolutionary change. Selection wins its role as a creative force because the other component of evolutionary mechanics â the forces that produce the raw material of genetic variation â are random, in the special sense of ânot inherently directed toward adaptation.â That is, if local environments change and smaller organisms are now at an advantage, genetic variation does not produce more small individuals, thus imparting a direction to evolutionary change from the level of variation itself. Variation continues to occurâat random,â in a broad spectrum about the average size. Selection must impart direction â and be the creative force of evolution â by differentially preserving those random variants yielding smaller than average phenotypes."

The concept of information, which you have chosen not to define for the transparent reason of employing a shifting definition, is not typically employed by biologists.

fact_2057	fact	"Oh, WJA, what a neat little trick. The claim had been made by your side... that he hadn't published an attempt to apply his filter. And, that he was running scarred. Are you now asking me to show where he has successfully demonstrated his filter, or are you asking me if he's attempted to demonstrate his filter...? And now you want his publication in a particular form too! Another slight of hand.  Despite this I countered that he has published.  I said Dembski had come up with a filter  The accusation was that he hadn't applied this to a biological system.  Yet everyone seems to be able to critique this 'invisible' application.  Now with typical aplomb WJA chimes in and you don't go down the path of SLP in actually making any claim. You want me to come up with the goods.  This is the neat trick. You've diverted things away from SLP's ludicrous and biased claim.  The claim was made by SLP without any proof.  The onus is on SLP to provide such proof. I have shown otherwise even if it is 'second hand evidence'. The inference from all the critiques quite clearly suggest that they have seen it applied, and reject it as a failure.  Nice try WJA. A small shift again of the argument.  However, because I'm trying to educate you I suggest your read the following.  ""In the actual encounter, Dembski began by overviewing his methods for design detection as developed in The Design Inference. He then  sketched how these methods apply to biology  and why he thought they provided in-principle objections to undirected natural causes, including Kauffman's self-organizational processes, generating the key item that his methods detect, namely, specified complexity or complex specified information. Dembski developed his argument as follows: the only way for self-organizational, Darwinian, and other naturalistic methods to generate specified complexity is by in essence dissolving the actual complexity (or improbability). What seems highly improbable is therefore no longer improbable once one knows the right naturalistic process. Dembski indicated that there were good reasons to think that no such reduction of complexity or improbability would be possible in the case of systems like the bacterial flagellum.  He also adverted to some of the techniques developed in his forthcoming book titled ""No Free Lunch"" for computing the probabilities of discrete combinatorial objects like the bacterial flagellum. ""  http://www.arn.org/docs/pjweekly/pj_weekly_011119.htm  This suggests that a book is about to appear mysteriously out of the ether...  So, go read the book  ""No Free Lunch: Why Specified Complexity Cannot Be Purchased Without Intelligence"". Unless you think it's not 'published'.  Oh, look it has been published! It's a miracle.  As far back as post 29 the answer was provided for one and all by SLP who wrote:  ""Unfortunately, Dembski and his ""explanatory"" filter are more hot air than substance. He has claiming to have 'discovered' desing (sic) in nature by using the 'filter', but for some strange reason, he has yet to publish his amazing discovery. he said he was going to do it in ""Mere Creation"", then he said it would be iun (sic)  No Free Lunch  - so tell us , IS IT actually in his newest collection of apocryphal tall tales, or is is (sic) just assumed that he has done so?""  The simple answer is 'yes he has'.  This mystery book exists. It's even been criticised by people on your side ""In his book, No Free Lunch,  Dembski presents the bacterial flagellum as the premier example of a biological system that, because he judges it to be both complex and specified, must have been actualized by the form-conferring action of an unembodied intelligent agent. However, a critical examination of Dembski?s case reveals that, 1) is is built  on unorthodox and inconsistently applied definitions of both ?complex? and ?specified,? 2) it employs a concept of the flagellum?s assembly that is radically out of touch with contemporary genetics and developmental biology, and 3)  it fails to demonstrate  that the flagellum is either ?complex? or ?specified? in the manner required to make his case. If the bacterial flagellum is supposed to demonstrate ID, then ID is a failure.""  http://www.iscid.org/ubbcgi/ultimate...=1;t=000057;p=  As I said, people on your side are out there criticising him all the time. How could they unless he had published?  Also, it is one thing to say that he hasn't attempted to apply the filter, then to say that he has attempted to apply it and failed.  ;) Game, set and match"
fact_1238	fact	"Well firstly we do not know that ""volition"" must be embodied in living organisms only - computers MIGHT be capable of exhibiting it.

fact_660	fact	Well, in the case above, it was step-by-step. First, an existing enzyme was modified to a new use, and over time, became refined to work better and better. This is the way evolution works. Nothing is de novo; it's always a modfication of something else. Second, a mutation produced a regulator that only allowed the enzyme to be produced if the substrate was available. Again, this was refined by natural selection over time. In the end, the newly-evolved system was irreducibly complex, because all three parts have to be present for the system to work.   And do show us your numbers proving that such processes can't produce new information. If you don't know how, I'd be pleased to show you how a mutation changes the information in a population.

And how do you propose to PROVE that only living things CAN be intelligent? What evidence would suffice? Clearly according to you communication over a network is NOT sufficient proof!  What you have in fact done is to claim that all living things are intelligent and that communication is not evidence of that intelligence.

Frankly I think you have no criterion in mind other than a system being what you call alive - itself a vague and difficult to pin down category! Are viruses intelligent or not?

fact_1012	fact	Thus showing in that analysis which include all possible codes (not only biosynthetically restricted codes) that the genetic code is partially optimal with regards to error minimization. It should be noted though that analysis only included a subset of the possible optimality feature of the code.  From article 3  The analysis above did not include other nearly optimal features of the genetic code including:  A) The actual code is far better than other possible codes in minimizing the number of amino acids incorporated until translation is interrupted after a frameshift error occurred.  B) The code is highly optimal for encoding arbitrary additional information, i.e., information other than the amino acid sequence in protein-coding sequences.  Thus, two more features for which the code is close to being optimal. What is interesting about these two optimal features is that they may facilitate evolution i.e. the code is primed for the future by being optimal in allowing future incorporation of additional information.  In article nr.4   The coevolution theory of the origin of the genetic code is discussed. The theory suggests that the genetic code is an imprint of the biosynthetic (biosynthetically restricted) relationships between amino acids.  A few interesting observations can be made:  Firstly, from the article:

Why do textbooks portray this fossil as the missing link between dinosaurs and modern birds -- even though modern birds are probably not descended from it, and its supposed ancestors do not appear until millions of years after it?READ MORE   PEPPERED MOTHS.

Why do textbooks claim that beak changes in Galapagos finches during a severe drought can explain the origin of species by natural selection -- even though the changes were reversed after the drought ended, and no net evolution occurred?

Why do textbooks use fruit flies with an extra pair of wings as evidence that DNA mutations can supply raw materials for evolution -- even though the extra wings have no muscles and these disabled mutants cannot survive outside the laboratory?

My point is that with all of the same basic tools to start out with such as fingers, opposable thumbs and walking upright, there is no reason why only our line evolved to the level that human beings have attained with the same hundreds of millions of years, and the same pressures pushing us all forward, or towards extinction.

Now, he took a kind of roundabout means of getting there, but that was more or less the conclusion of the film. Our society is a messed up place and people are scared. I am not sure that he is right that they have no reason to be (just look at our crime statistics).  Watching the film, it almost looks like he set out to make one movie then ended up making another. The first 2/3 of the film certainly seemed like the message was ""guns are evil"". It wasn't until the end that you come to the revelation that his message is not ""guns are evil"".

fact_2321	fact	Let's see if you will stand by this load of absolute garbage.   My great, great, great grandfather dug a hole when he was 15. He put a time capsule in that hole. After years of erosion, I come across it at the same time a dead bug is found near it. According to you, they are both the same age since they were both found on top of the ground.   Do you agree with this or do you disagree?
fact_1628	fact	I'm not convinced that the fund people didn't turn their heads in China, but I am otherwise in agreement with the editorial.  And it is great to have a president I can feel good about again. As an American, I intend not to agree with him about everything, either.
fact_24	fact	Actually the room, straps, and table are all multi-use. And the drugs only cost Texas $86.08 per execution as of 2002.
fact_2335	fact	"The ""truth"" about atheism is that it's the only proposition that makes sense (apart from agnosticism ?) to people who conclude, as I do, that religious principles are not based on reason.  I know it's a bit unusual in a public forum but I'd like to introduce a little personal history here by way of illustration of my path to atheism: I was educated during my most impressionable years (11-18) at a grammar school controlled by the Jesuits. All my teachers were priests and many were of formidable intellect. Every morning began with ""divine service"", every lesson was started and ended with a prayer. At noon we sang the Angelus and at 3.30 in the afternoon we finished the school day with Benediction. We had at least one session a day learning and reciting the catechism - so we could be word perfect in our answers to metaphysical questions. Yet all this religious conditioning failed to arouse any spark of faith in me. Sure, I conformed to all outward appearances, but inwardly I rebelled and I did not believe. So why didn't I believe - because my clergymen teachers gave me no REASONS to do so. When, eventually, during my last days at school I chose to reveal my disbelief - the Rector said, ""Well, after all, faith is a gift from God !"" , and I had received no such gift.   Since, in my view, there is no reasoned evidence for God's existence, why succumb to wish-fulfillment ? It's less comforting but more honest to be an atheist."
fact_258	fact	Well, this comes from the same people who invented the death pannels. The truth is that all the developed countries (all of Europe, Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan, Israel) have universal healthcare. Their COST per capita is about half of ours. They have better outcomes.  Universal healthcare has been tried in many places and it does work. What does not work is our current system. Wellpoint has just increased premiums by 30% even wiyhout a reform bill. They spend 30% on administrative costs.  BTW, do you oppose the bill that would force them to limit the administrative costs to 20%?
fact_264	fact	"But the Court went further than necessary. They set the point at which States could legally impose restrictions on abortion negating many state statutes in the process and establishing the ""right to abortion"" ON DEMAND at any time. That was an exercise in judicial activism. They took statures that existed in many states and arbitrarily determined at what point they could be applied. It's not the Court's function to legislate from the bench. It is up to the States and Federal Legislatures to determine at what point the fetus' rights are protected."
fact_1833	fact	"More like the late 1940s. Look up A.C. Braun and Crown Gall. Granted he did not know the details be he did know that bacteria could transfer ""something"" {the TIP} which permantely transformed plant tissues. Later it turned out to be a bacterial plasmid."

fact_516	fact	They have changed. For example, ancient examples of coelacanth were shallow water species, while the modern coelacanth is a deep marine species (actually, two or three species). And the differences are enough to put them in different families.  By the way, ark guy, what do you know about taxonomy?
fact_270	fact	Yeah, there is no species of that name.
fact_1199	fact	This shows that people have heart problems even when they're not obese and don't consume fatty foods, which goes AGAINST your original argument.
fact_927	fact	I would like to propose reasons that the theory of evolution is in jeopardy. First, you must realize that evolution is still a theory. Otherwise it would be called the Law of Evolution. We have the laws of physics, the laws of chemistry, the laws of mathematics, the laws of thermodynamics. These are all proved and documented and provide the basis of all our technology. They are true and wholeheartedly accepted by everyone. They are the Laws of the Universe. For evolution to become a law, it must fall in line with the other laws. There can be no contradictions. The truth must be the truth.   The Second Law of Thermodynamics states that Entropy must remain the same or increase. Entropy is the tendency toward chaos. Increasing entropy means increasing chaos. The universe is winding down on an irreversible path. Every process that takes place in nature, whether mechanical, electrical, chemical, or biological is winding down, becoming more chaotic. All processes will finally cease, and the Universe will stop. That is a scientific fact.   If the Universe is running down, becoming more chaotic all the time, how is it possible for any material to suddenly become more orderly, more organized, more complex. Scientists say, that random encounters of atoms, molecules, joining and splitting, eventually create order. I'm sorry, that's in direct contradiction to the Second Law. It would also violate the statisically probability of such an occurrence even over billions of years, especially in light of the complexity of organized biological systems and processes.   Which brings me to the second reason that evolution is in jeopardy: there is a huge difference between living and non-living things. There is a gigantic leap forward required to produce even a single-celled amoeba from a goo that contains all the elements required to make an amoeba. The goo is total chaos. The amoeba is a highly organized and complex living creature. The odds of random mixing by weather, earthquake, etc. that would produce an amoeba would be one in a billion billion billion. It's not going to happen.  Thirdly, look at DNA. Scientists are mapping the human genome, the very basis of life itself. What are they finding? Recorded information that literally contains the blueprint of a human being. Information so complex and so vast that it is taking literally years to decipher. And every bit of the human body carries DNA. Theorically, it is possible to take this blueprint and create a whole new human. How can a living creature so complex be an accident of nature?   Fourth, how do you explain human consciousness? How does this highly complex body of flesh and blood with its organic brain have the ability to not only be aware of the world, but also be aware of himself as a unique person? There is no biological or medical reason determined so far, despite decades of study. What freak accident could possibly have occurred to give the first descendant of apes the first spark of awareness?
fact_1416	fact	After what the Fins been through, fighting the mother country, the Soviet Union under Lenin and then Russia and Germany and finally Germany, I doubt they are going to let their own government take away their guns??  Most folks have learned to leave those Finns alone. emoticonXSmilie
fact_1370	fact	"Usually, but most of this has been quoted out of context by creationists and answered so often that it is an old story. Besides, as I mentioned, Feduccia has just published a detailed study on the embryology of bird digits. It supports his view, of course. I don't have a problem with that and it is certainly an issue worth study. My days of ornithology and embryology were long ago.  Also, since those papers were published there have been several more feathered dinosaurs and primative birds discovered. Things are moving fast right now. Jeff Polling also has some information about the Ruben et al. article.  But the ""bird hip/lizard hip"" bit is pure nonsense that demonstrates profound ignorance or intentional deceit. The correct information is so easy to find. That sort of conduct certainly casts a bad light on creationism."
fact_1364	fact	Well the continual occurrence of shootings at schools that outlaw concealed carry, vs the lack of any shootings at schools that allow concealed carry, would suggest something along those lines.
fact_933	fact	"Yes. It describes an action without ascribing its form to its end result, outcome, whatever but strictly to a cause/s force/s in action. That is why 'selection' is always teleological. In order to select or choose anything, an end must always be in view. There must always be a volitional discrimination of options based upon a criterion dictated by the desired end. The only time ""channel"" becomes teleological is when something live [a human or a beaver, let's say] intententionally does the channeling. But since it is understood that mechanical forces can also 'channel', unintentional, out of simple mechanics, the word channel cannot be called teleological. In the same way, 'sorting' can be considered non-teleological, hence mechanical, and thus suited to your glossary, because things can be sorted by mechanical forces alone. But 'selection' always requires volition and awareness. So 'selection' is always teleological."
fact_1402	fact	So you only class an abortion as something that occurs 8 weeks after conception?  That's your line to draw. However, I doubt you could persuade many courts that 'looking like a human' was a valid qualifier for being a person.  Everyone draws the line somewhere - be it conception, birth, or some point in between the two (if not before or after, in some cases). That doesn't mean that their version of 'the line' should automatically be the legal one. At the moment (in the UK, at least), that line is legally drawn at the point when the baby becomes viable; that is, when it could potentially survive a premature birth. Before that point, everyone can choose their own qualifiers.  You can argue that the line should be legally redrawn... but I doubt 'looking like a human' will be considered the strongest of arguments.
fact_2123	fact	Actually it is events like these that led the two most exhaustive studies ever done gun control to conclude this.     51 of the best gun control studies the WORLD had to offer
fact_1358	fact	Yes, every living thing is made up of cells.
fact_2137	fact	There's absolutely no way in hell this could be legal in any sense. That California school got ***** slapped for expelling a student who had a gun off campus, beyond the jurisdictional reach of the school. So how can this school believe they can get away with such an insane policy?
fact_728	fact	No it doesn't. First, the changes may not be neutral. I will presume that you are intelligent enough to grasp that idea the mutations in and of themselves are neither advantagous nor disadvantageous, and the they have no purpose. Evolution happens when the mutations (and other mechanisms that increase genetic diversity) are acted upon by other mechanisms of evolution. Even in natural selection there is no purpose. Natural selection is differential reproductive success. Some organisms tend to produce more offspring because they have characteristics that give them an advantage in a particular environment.
fact_700	fact	In my lifetime, we've made huge strides, but there's a lot more to learn.
fact_714	fact	Except several rligious organizations around the country have financed, and gathered signatures to put anti gay marriage amendments on the ballot. They have a religious belief that marriage is between one man and one woman. They have turned this belief into law regaurdless of the religious beliefs of gay people. Any one who has voted yes to place these amendments into state constitutions because they have a religious belief that excludes gay people from marriage has also imposed those religious beliefs upon gay people. In short I have been barred from marrying the person I love because someone else, that I do not know and who does not know me, has some sick religious belief.
fact_715	fact	While it may be true that an ovum is formed during the mother's fetal stage, an ovum is not a unique human entity in and of itself. It does not become a unique human entity until it is fertilized at conception.   (Do you like semantics games?) ;)
fact_701	fact	Wrong again. A nervous system is required in order to feel pain. Many species of living-flesh animals have no nervous system and cannot feel pain of any description...crickets included.  I do not know at what point the nervous system in a fetus is developed enough to transmit pain signals.
fact_729	fact	Correct. Form letters go in a junk pile. Individual letters are a different matter.
fact_1359	fact	The VAST majority of abortions occur within the first trimester. Abortions at 21 weeks and over are pretty rare.
fact_2136	fact	Or do you think that the Big Bang didn't happen?
fact_2122	fact	Oh dear. We once again see the fallacious 'information' argument being used. The craters on the moon give us information about past impacts, do we demand that information has a 'sender'? Spectroscopy gives us information about the constitution of stars, do we demand that information has a 'sender'?  And indeed even if we use the argument that all 'information' has a sender and recipient, genetic material has...neither. It's just chemicals and forces. Nothing more. There is no identifiable 'sender', and there is no identifiable 'recipient'. Sure, you can chuck a god in here or there if you like, but that's not where the evidence leads. DNA is not a code, DNA is certainly not a 'language', and it only falls under the definition of 'information' that pretty much everything we decide to look at does.

fact_1403	fact	Well, we do, actually. That is why we send the woman for numerous OB checks throughout the pregnancy.
fact_932	fact	Well, it doesn't, so it isn't. Biology is well aware that many things have volition, and there are whole branches of biology dedicated to studying it. Animal behavior they call it. However, biology doesn't not pretend that every living thing has volition.
fact_1417	fact	#1 is above.  The Jesus myth came out of Hellenistic Judaism already heavily imbued with the ideas of the suffering servant (Isaiah 53) and the son of God subject to a shameful death (Wisdom of Solomon âLet us condemn him with a shameful deathâ). Paul refers to the âarchonsâ, the evil heavenly rulers of the age, as those who crucified Jesus (1 Cor 2:8) and extols the justice of the Romans (Ro. 13:1-3). The earliest layers of Q material do not refer to a death or resurrection (Kloppenborg). No earthly Jesus, no crucifixion, no death. It is all myth, man.
fact_926	fact	Another strawman.      Explain to me how new information and new features equals to new structures and body parts.      Those links have long been refuted      http://www.creationwiki.org/(Talk.Origins)_Mutations_don%27t_add_information   http://www.creationwiki
fact_1371	fact	So what are some examples of restrictive gun laws in South Africa? The people in South Africa think their gun laws are not strict enough.   In one of your previous posts you seem determined to use South Africa as evidence that outlawing guns doesn't work. But gun ownership is still legal there.

fact_271	fact	Actually, the biological development begins when the ovum is formed, when its mom is a fetus herself.
fact_265	fact	"So-called ""Partial Birth"" Abortions are so rare as to be negligible. This ban was just a small step onto taking away a woman's right to choice.  If it were a ""born baby"" then they wouldn't have to perform the abortion. It would be able to survive in a respirator.  There you go again misusing a legal term.  You are the sick one for using emotional arguements and ignoring the facts."

It's all around self-organising systems and the earth as a self-regulating system/organsism/something or other. James Lovelock and co. Interesting to read but sometimes feels a little too 'lets-all-just-get-along' to be real, hard-core theory.   Either way, it's probably a lot more likely to be accepted than creationism, should evolutionism for some reason be disproved.

I also found articles on the same subject from papers all over the country as well as in other countries such as Romania.  Save your snobbery for someone else.
fact_25	fact	Just how many gun clubs do you think there are in this area? If a thief plans to steal guns, it is therefore logical for them to choose members of a Gun Club, and follow them home!  What do you expect the criminals to do? Go to a anti-gun rally and follow the Antis home?

If ID is not science, then none of the above is science, yet it is in today's science classes.
fact_31	fact	"the problem with a ""un-genesis style"" creation is that it would effectively nullify everything in the bible. the biblical god both created life on earth in 6 days and sent his son to die for the sins of humankind. to me there is something very wrong with blatantly rejecting one biblical claim and blindly embracing another  the god in this context (one that created the world some other way, and may not necessarily disapprove gays) may also not care about your ethical code. then such a god's existence should have no bearing on how we live our lives, now would it?  if such a god requires us to be ethical, is not against homosexuality, and created the world in a way other than genesis' description, then you are talking about a god of specific characteristics that would lend itself to a precise definition. we would require a lengthy list of rules by which we should live, and a description of how the world was actually created, as well as historical references of god's interaction with mankind in times past. you'd end up with another bible"
fact_1601	fact	Wrong and right.   Evolution is both a verified phenomenon and a biological Theory.
fact_2308	fact	And I've never seen anyone present observational evidence that would indicate that all creatures were specially created. Please do so.
fact_19	fact	Not by any means. Evolution works on genetic change that future generations will inherit. Adaptation does no such thing. It changes an individual, but not its genes.  For example, if my parents volunteered to be part of a scientific experiment where they two additional arms fused onto their body before I was ever conceived, I would not be born with two extra arms.  On the other hand, if a genetic mutation made it advantageous to have two additional arms, and both my parents had that mutation, I would be born with both arms.
fact_1167	fact	Well, the now late Dr Crick can have all the odd ideas he wants, but unless it is backed up by evidence, it isn't science.  Yes, naturalism is a presupposition. On the other hand, it works. It makes predictions and it lets us do such things as make the very computer you are using. What kind of verifiable and repeatable predictions supernaturalism makes??

There's really no point in debating your specific threads as you cowardly run away from them on a weekly basis.  I just like to remind people that you have no understanding of erosion that are so gulliable you bought hook line and sinker the paintings of villagers who based their art on comic books as proof of creation.

fact_463	fact	"Actually, you gave (and misspelled) one of the common names given to the fossil, ""Turkana Boy"" It is also sometimes called ""Nariokotome Boy"". But the real designation of the fossil is KNM-WT 15000 and any knowledgeable discussion of that fossil will refer to it as such. That fact, by the way, is how I know that Turkana Boy and Nariokotome Boy are one and the same fossil."
fact_2283	fact	No it doesn't. It tells us that creationists are either liars of very sloppy in gathering samples. I suspect that you've been duped again, and as usual, nothing but assertion without evidence.
fact_305	fact	And they have. The only reason you think a fetus is equatable to a human is because it is made of organic matter. What if there was a piece of cardboard in the mothers stomach? Its non-organic and is in the same mental state as an embryo (that is, no mental state). The only difference is the matter its made out of.
fact_311	fact	Catholics have a different belief. The goal is to always save both mother and child. If the fetus dies during the attempt to save both, then that's what happens. For instance, with an ectopic pregnancy, the goal isn't to kill he fetus, the goal is to save both mother and fetus.
fact_2297	fact	Or in any culture. Women abort WORLDWIDE you know jyoshu.  For what it's worth, I certainly AM bothered by this if it's true.

fact_1991	fact	In reverse? The scientific method begins with an observation. Then an hypothesis is proposed that will explain the observation. Then a prediction is made that must be true as a consequence, if the prediction is correct. Then methods are devised to test the prediction. What is described in the paper is the last step. Majerus already has his hypothesis and his prediction and is accumulating the data that will support them.
fact_1749	fact	"But ""laws"" are just observations that may be part of theories. Perhaps if you made an effort to learn what science is and how it works."
fact_1985	fact	"Well, ""reasonable"" is clearly subjective... So the authors of the letter are practicly saying that any gun laws not interfering with the state militia would be permited according to the second amendment. But that gun laws obviously should be reasonable. But what reasonable is, is best left to the democratic will of the people. Or am I reading it wrong?"
fact_2254	fact	Are you referring to the Epicurians? Aristotle? I can't think of any reference to these people as atheists. Socrates was accused of being an atheist, and the accusation made it clear this was because he didn't believe in the gods. Some schools of Hinduism have been atheistic from BC, and Buddhism (founded before 400 BC) is essentially atheistic, in that there are 'gods' but they are considered limited and not given much importance.  More generally, I think modern atheists and fundamentalists are both largely the result of   1) the breakdown in everyone conforming to one religion, probably starting at the Reformation  2) the scientific outlook making people mistake religious meaning for scientific meaning, causing them to either think the Bible must be scientifically true because it's religiously meaningful, or that it must be religiously meaningless because it's scientifically false. Richard Dawkins and the average creationist make the same fundamental mistake - the greeks would say they mistook 'muthos' (myth, allegory) for 'logos' (reason, science)

fact_2268	fact	But it really does deal with thinking. It can invite a more wide open scientific investigation of ecological and developmental patterns. It's not politically afraid to pursue facts about newly discovered complexities of life which pose problems for those trying to make a case for happenstance origins.

For evolution to have occurred requires neither that a mutation be new nor useful and they don't require new structures nor structures.  Here's a little mental exercise for you. At most, a person can have only two alleles for any gene. This would have been the condition of the human race 6,000 years ago according to creationists. It would not have been possible for there to be more than 2 alleles for any given gene. Now consider that for every gene in the human genome there is an average of 14 different alleles, sometimes more, sometimes less. Where did all of those alleles come from?"

fact_1577	fact	Indeed.  If a teacher teaches 'the controversey' correctly, and lays out the facts and let's kids decide for themselves (is that done for ANY subject?), certainly, the most indoctrinated will say creation wins. But what about the open-minded? What about the students that can actually grasp the fact that creationism offers nothing in the way of supporting evidence? that is rests solely on trying to poke holes in evolution and appeals to biblical authority? Those students will conclude that creatiomnism is bogus, and may cause them to question their 'beliefs.'  Two things could happen:  1. the Right -wing zealots will enforce laws making it a crime to put creationism ina poor light, forcing teachers to bow down or be fired. Conservative correctness with the force of law.  2. the Right-wing zealots will realize that their little plan backfired, and let the issue die   Scarily, if this should come to pass, if things do not change much politically, I see option 1 as the most likely.

4forums_11082	fact-4forums-boot3	Radiocarbon is nevr used for 'millions of years'. It's used to measure human developments.  I suggest you read this.  Radiometric dating--the process of determining the age of rocks from the decay of their radioactive elements--has been in widespread use for over half a century. There are over forty such techniques, each using a different radioactive element or a different way of measuring them. It has become increasingly clear that these radiometric dating techniques agree with each other and as a whole, present a coherent picture in which the Earth was created a very long time ago. Further evidence comes from the complete agreement between radiometric dates and other dating methods such as counting tree rings or glacier ice core layers. Many Christians have been led to distrust radiometric dating and are completely unaware of the great number of laboratory measurements that have shown these methods to be consistent. Many are also unaware that Bible-believing Christians are among those actively involved in radiometric dating.  This paper describes in relatively simple terms how a number of the dating techniques work, how accurately the half-lives of the radioactive elements and the rock dates themselves are known, and how dates are checked with one another. In the process the paper refutes a number of misconceptions prevalent among Christians today. This paper is available on the web via the American Scientific Affiliation and related sites to promote greater understanding and wisdom on this issue, particularly within the Christian community.

The actual gene encodes a protein of 475 amino acids that becomes a mature protein of 448 amino acids after cleavage of a signal peptide. One study was able to identify 3 common SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) in the coding region of the gene, 2 of which result in small changes in enzyme function in European populations. The third SNP converts that locus to a stop codon and results in an enzyme that is 447 amino acids long. Thus, the enzyme has been truncated. The resulting enzyme, LPL S447X, is functional. In fact, it results in lower incidence of vascular disease and lower blood pressure. Other truncations result in non-functional enzymes.

Theory: A theory is more like a scientific law than a hypothesis. A theory is an explanation of a set of related observations or events based upon proven hypotheses and verified multiple times by detached groups of researchers. One scientist cannot create a theory; he can only create a hypothesis.  In general, both a scientific theory and a scientific law are accepted to be true by the scientific community as a whole. Both are used to make predictions of events. Both are used to advance technology.    Compare that definition to a religion.

We know that many evolutionists hold to the idea that we evolved over eons of years from  simple  organisms that eventually evolved from a bacterium. This leads us in to ask the question, where did that bacterium come from? Evolutionists say it was spontaneously produced by a lightning strike in some primeval sea. We can then ask, where did the Earth come from and where did the Solar System come from? To which we are told everything was formed as a result of the big bang about 13 billion years ago, give or take a few billion years.  You may choose to prove any one of these three events is scientific in response to the original topic. The mutations and natural selections and changes we see in animals today is not an area for debate as creationists and evolutionists are in complete agreence over these events as they can be tested and observed. The area in which we have debate is the interpretation about the origins of the scientific evidence, for example, the fossils, animals and plants, planets, rocks and so on.

And you are right, the phenomenon of revertant mutation in eusocial bacteria colonies, [inexplicable in darwinist mechanical terms], as discovered by Cairns, et al, in 1988, is a separate phenomenon from stress-stimulated somatic hyper-mutation. I misled you in the the quote you used to bring in the Cairns work--    Under these circumstances [stress-induced hyper-mutation], as per EAM,[above], it has been repeatedly demonstrated [since 1988, at Corning, by that scientist whose name escapes me] that the number of adaptive mutations outnumbers the number of of ineffectual or maladaptive mutations by a strongly significant statistical percentage.   That was not Cairns, but Barry G. Hall to whom I was referring, and he was a research prof at U. Rochester in the 90's who did work on adaptive mutation, wrt adaptive cellular responses in stressed eusocial bacteria colonies. That is, somatic hypermutation as a cellular,[in multi-cellular organisms, such as eubacteria colonies], adaptive, systemic and systematic [non-randon, non-stochastic, non-accidental] heuristic evolutionary mechanism.  He found that adaptive genetic mutations arising systematically under these circumstances outnumbered maladaptive and inconsequential mutations to a high degree, statistically speaking. A most significant finding, and one that has been repeated again and again and again, to the point where somatic hypermutation is accepted by bacteriologists as a legitimate 'immune response' enabling rapid adaptive [EAM] evolution [antibiotic resistance] in eusocial bacteria.

Radiometric dating--the process of determining the age of rocks from the decay of their radioactive elements--has been in widespread use for over half a century. There are over forty such techniques, each using a different radioactive element or a different way of measuring them. It has become increasingly clear that these radiometric dating techniques agree with each other and as a whole, present a coherent picture in which the Earth was created a very long time ago. Further evidence comes from the complete agreement between radiometric dates and other dating methods such as counting tree rings or glacier ice core layers. Many Christians have been led to distrust radiometric dating and are completely unaware of the great number of laboratory measurements that have shown these methods to be consistent. Many are also unaware that Bible-believing Christians are among those actively involved in radiometric dating.  This paper describes in relatively simple terms how a number of the dating techniques work, how accurately the half-lives of the radioactive elements and the rock dates themselves are known, and how dates are checked with one another. In the process the paper refutes a number of misconceptions prevalent among Christians today. This paper is available on the web via the American Scientific Affiliation and related sites to promote greater understanding and wisdom on this issue, particularly within the Christian community.

Even as adults, not everyone is equally quick-witted, not everyone has an equal facility for logical thought - and this has a lot to do with how their brain has been trained during its development.

The actual gene encodes a protein of 475 amino acids that becomes a mature protein of 448 amino acids after cleavage of a signal peptide. One study was able to identify 3 common SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) in the coding region of the gene, 2 of which result in small changes in enzyme function in European populations. The third SNP converts that locus to a stop codon and results in an enzyme that is 447 amino acids long. Thus, the enzyme has been truncated. The resulting enzyme, LPL S447X, is functional. In fact, it results in lower incidence of vascular disease and lower blood pressure. Other truncations result in non-functional enzymes.

Theory: A theory is more like a scientific law than a hypothesis.

One scientist cannot create a theory; he can only create a hypothesis.  In general, both a scientific theory and a scientific law are accepted to be true by the scientific community as a whole. Both are used to make predictions of events. Both are used to advance technology.    Compare that definition to a religion.

We know that many evolutionists hold to the idea that we evolved over eons of years from  simple  organisms that eventually evolved from a bacterium. This leads us in to ask the question, where did that bacterium come from? Evolutionists say it was spontaneously produced by a lightning strike in some primeval sea. We can then ask, where did the Earth come from and where did the Solar System come from? To which we are told everything was formed as a result of the big bang about 13 billion years ago, give or take a few billion years.  You may choose to prove any one of these three events is scientific in response to the original topic. The mutations and natural selections and changes we see in animals today is not an area for debate as creationists and evolutionists are in complete agreence over these events as they can be tested and observed. The area in which we have debate is the interpretation about the origins of the scientific evidence, for example, the fossils, animals and plants, planets, rocks and so on.

In nature, bacteria are rarely found in isolation, and evolution appears to have provided a mechanism that allows them to detect when they are in heterogeneous communities, to assess the proportions of self and other in mixed-species environments, and to respond to this information by appropriately modulating gene expression.

It was capable of powered flight. It had tiny, spiky teeth in its beak and was the size of a sparrow. Its hip was primitive compared to modern birds; its ilium, ischium, and pubis were all parallel and directed backward. Iberomesornis was named by paleontologists Sanz and Bonaparte in 1992. Fossils were found in Spain. The type species is I. romeralli.  ICHTHYORNIS  Ichthyornis (meaning  fish bird ) were 8 inch (20 cm) long, toothed, tern-like, extinct bird that date from the late Cretaceous period. It had a large head and beak. This powerful flyer is the oldest-known bird that had a keeled breastbone (sternum) similar to that of modern birds. It lived in flocks nesting on shorelines, and hunted for fish over the seas. Ichthyornis was originally found in 1872 in Kansas, USA, by a member of paleontologist Othniel C. Marsh's Yale University expedition. Fossils have been found in Kansas and Texas, USA and Alberta, Canada.

Often that is done through a soul. The principle argument I've argued in their similarities is that of why they do such a thing. What cannot be explained now or its relation to the greater whole is credited to a supernatural being, a being or set of beings that exists not entirely of the natural world. Where ancient animists believed that lightning was associated with the Gods, and that Volcanoes were the manifestation of Pele, the principle is the same. What cannot be explained or understood now is of a higher being. How did this rock get here? Where did deer come from? How do they exist in the larger picture? Animists assign souls, or anima to the inanimate and animate objects as a way to place what they do not understand into a coherent organized picture.  Intelligent design is no different. Only that it has replaced lightning, volcanoes and rain with the human eye and origin of the life. While it may not use the same identical concepts of anima to inanimate object, the core logic is identical.  What is too complex to understand or explain now is of a higher being.

Not only is unpredictability inherent in such systems, but the more ways you try to manipulate them, the more uncertain the reaction to any particular intervention becomes.  So what do you do then, just take this method anyway, even given you can't predict the results, just take your best shot?

Any complaints about telescope time echo the complaints of astronomers everwhere that have to clamor and compete for the same telescopes.  And I just looked up Gentry because I've never heard of him.  I'd say that if he is  suppressed  then its merely due to the fact that he hasn't survived the peer review process. This is true for any number of people who have devised alternate theories to the BB. None of these guys has a beef with godless creation, they just think they have the right answer. There are people into the plasma universe, and the electric universe, or whatever, then there are people like Eugene Savov and his  fireworks  universe. These people are generally considered crackpots, but they aren't pushing creationism, they are just pushing theories weaker than the BB theory. But really, the BB theory has problems all over the place, most physicists will admit this.  But Alton Harp hasn't produced enough of these  weird  redshift images to have any significant statistical impact. I think he has cataloged a few dozen of these, most of which can be explained away.

The Delaware Department of Justice initially insisted to The News that gun purchasers must declare who the weapon was intended for so that person's background could be checked. Yesterday, a spokeswoman for the Delaware Department of Justice said it misinterpreted the law and that Brady was not obligated to state that the gun was for her son as long as he was legally qualified to own a firearm.   In addition, a spokesman for Brady said, 'Sarah Brady told the gun store that the gun was for her son and filled out the forms that they asked her to fill out.'   The News regrets the error.

Theory: A theory is more like a scientific law than a hypothesis. A theory is an explanation of a set of related observations or events based upon proven hypotheses and verified multiple times by detached groups of researchers. One scientist cannot create a theory; he can only create a hypothesis.  In general, both a scientific theory and a scientific law are accepted to be true by the scientific community as a whole. Both are used to make predictions of events. Both are used to advance technology.    Compare that definition to a religion. Religions are made up of people who believe in something and ask for no proof and ignore evidence to the contrary.

Yet the Darwinists seem to grant pieces of DNA the power to ?selfishly? control entire organisms.

Once volition is acknowledged as an aspect of living systems, the mechanisms may be found.

Twenty-first century biologists will turn away from materialistic reductionism and investigate the non materialistic role of consciousness, volition, memory and information -- none of which take up space.

4forums_8957	fact-4forums-boot2	There are lot's of things that conduct electricity to some degree or another.  Polysilanes, for just one example, has a backbone of -Si-Si-Si-, and conducts because the sigma orbitals of Si are diffuse enough to overlap.  It's this de-localization of electrons that allows for conductivity.  If a carbon polymer has a lot of double/triple bonds or benzene rings then it should conduct.  Just like graphite, which is much more conductive along the a and b axes (the axes where the graphene planes lie) because of all the electronic delocalization.  But it's a poor conductor along the c-axis, because there are only weak pi-pi interactions and little orbital overlap.  Sulfur, I suppose would be a poor candidate for the basis of life.  The only times it forms more than two bonds is if it is bonded to a very electronegative atom like oxygen or fluorine. Also, it does not catenate very easily, and if it did, it would just be a chain of sulfur (no longer than 8 atoms long) with practically no functionality.

4forums_955	fact-4forums-boot2	No, it's not.  The conditions under which evolution operated during the Cambrian/Vendian times were different from the conditions following that time in two main ways, and these differences can potentially account for the origin of the many animal body plans during those early periods and the lack of new ones since.  First, ~540 million years ago most animals were very much simpler (fewer cells, for example) than they are today, so changes to their developmental programs would have been better tolerated. The more complex any system is (the more parts it has, and the more coordinated and well-matched those parts must be, etc.), the more rigidly constrained and less amenable to a given magnitude of change it is. So the simpler developmental processes (simpler adult-form end product, fewer interactions between developmental genes, etc.) of early animals would have allowed for a 'large-scale' change to be incorporated into that animal's ontogeny, though if a change of the same magnitude were to occur today, it would be too disruptive to the complex developmental program and would be eliminated (note that 'large-scale change' refers to the adult form: the actual change that caused that altered end result could be a typical small scale mutation, in an early developmental stage). This it not to propose Goldschmidt's  hopeful monsters  that occur due to 'macromutations', but rather an intermediate position between that and the  only micromutations  view of gradualistic neo-Darwinism. And, as just mentioned, mutations in developmental processes (even ones that resulted in 'macromutations' in the adult form) would have been more tolerated in the simpler animals that existed ~540 mya than they would be in today's.  Second, ~540 million years ago animal diversity was extremely more limited than it is today, so there was a huge number of open niches: a plentitude the likes of which has never again existed on our planet. An organism that happened to find itself in one of the multitude of open niches (by means of a  semi-macro  mutation, the product of a change in a developmental gene) would have faced little if any competition. The reduced external competition would potentially allow the morphological variation(s), that would otherwise likely have been eliminated, to persist. (The sudden change could leave the organism with a lower level of internal coordination: over time, internal coadaptation could evolve to 'catch up' with the change in morphology: these internal adjustments would leave no trace in the fossil record).  Combining these two ideas produces a reasonable explanation of the 'explosion' in new body plans in Vendian/Cambrian times.

4forums_206	fact-4forums-boot2	MUSCARELLO v. UNITED STATES  Now consider a different, somewhat special meaning of the word ÃâcarryÃâÃâa meaning upon which the linguistic arguments of petitioners and the dissent must rest. The Oxford English DictionaryÃâs twenty-sixth definition of ÃâcarryÃâ is Ãâbear, wear, hold up, or sustain, as one moves about; habitually to bear about with one.Ãâ 2 Oxford English Dictionary, supra, at 921. WebsterÃâs defines ÃâcarryÃâ as Ãâto move while supporting,Ãâ not just in a vehicle, but also Ãâin oneÃâs hands or arms.Ãâ WebsterÃâs Third New International Dictionary, supra, at 343. And BlackÃâs Law Dictionary defines the entire phrase Ãâcarry arms or weaponsÃâ as  ÃâTo wear, bear or carry them upon the person or in the clothing or in a pocket, for the purpose of use, or for the purpose of being armed and ready for offensive or defensive action in case of a conflict with another person.Ãâ BlackÃâs Law Dictionary 214 (6th ed. 1990).  These special definitions, however, do not purport to limit the Ãâcarrying of armsÃâ to the circumstances they describe. No one doubts that one who bears arms on his person Ãâcarries a weapon.Ãâ But to say that is not to deny that one may also Ãâcarry a weaponÃâ tied to the saddle of a horse or placed in a bag in a car.  Nor is there any linguistic reason to think that Congress intended to limit the word ÃâcarriesÃâ in the statute to any of these special definitions. To the contrary, all these special definitions embody a form of an important, but secondary, meaning of Ãâcarry,Ãâ a meaning that suggests support rather than movement or transportation, as when, for example, a column ÃâcarriesÃâ the weight of an arch. 2 Oxford English Dictionary, supra, at 919, 921.

White officers captured from white units were treated as prisoners. White soldiers who didn't even speak english recruited off immigrantion ships from Europe were paid the normal amount.

4forums_10623	fact-4forums-boot2	Another thing that is quite clear (or at least should be) is that there will never be a way to  fight  TOE with God - it's just not gonna happen...ever.  TOE is chocked full of logical, reasonable, and, for the most part, valid scientific data. There is no logic in belief whatsoever.
4forums_10151	fact-4forums-boot2	Really, what is the materialistinc approach to which you refer (assuming you're also talking about 'pain')?  a) Is it strictly materialistic, or do they use non-material methods as well?  b) Can it be used to onbjectively measure pain?
4forums_7343	fact-4forums-boot2	Actually, this data point is perfectly meaningless.  NONE of the other information (or the conclusions) presented in this talk require  26 .  If we made it 260, does it change ANY of the other conclusions? No.  A failure to recognize non-sequitur data tidbits is usually indicative of an argument that includes other errors.
4forums_9346	fact-4forums-boot2	No. In 1996 there was a shooting massacre in Port Arthur, in the countries south. The new government had just been voted in, and it was their first act, right on the back of this massacre, to tighten gun laws up significantly. Riding on the back of public horror at the massacre, it was rushed through, approved by both the upper and lower houses, and made law.
4forums_3694	fact-4forums-boot2	I think it's pretty clear that this is in violation of the Supreme Court's current abortion jurisprudence, at least to the extent that one could actually figure that out. The question is, are there enough justices on the Supreme Court who would reverse the judge-made Constitutional Amendment which granted an absolute right to abortion.
4forums_689	fact-4forums-boot2	It is 'change over time', not 'gradual change over time'. The morphological changes tend to happen with a change in the environment.  The difference between 'micro' evolution and 'macro' evolution is the number of steps.  Macro  evolution is a bunch of 'micro' evoltultions that add up. You have two populations that you can compare that used to interbreed, and for some reason, do not, and then you add on a few 1000 'mircro-evolution' events to each, they become very very different.
4forums_8931	fact-4forums-boot2	You see the physical manifestations but there's nothing that can be shown that God still cannot cause an earthquake or flood when he wants to. For instance, is he the one who can tweak a continental plate when he wants to, or cause flood-related weather patterns?  See above. Nothing has been demonstrated that convinces me that God has been ruled out of all these issues. He probably isn't active in all situations, but there's nothing that says he (or even Satan) are totally inconsequential either.
