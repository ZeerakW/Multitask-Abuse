feel_2281	feel	Oh, well. Apparently you want to talk molecular chemistry whereas I was hoping to discuss organismic evolution. Too bad. Good luck with anyone who wants to debate your topic, but it just doesn't interest me.
feel_2295	feel	I've heard a lot of naive stuff before, but that's a new one. I don't think I've ever heard anything more simpleminded in nature.  With your own government dictating that you can't inflict injury on those that would hurt you, they're not acting in your best interest. Nor are they when the police are tasked with making sure your windows and doors are locked up tight at night.
feel_2336	feel	Are you trying to make a point here? Or are you just spewing forth your hoplophobic tendencies because you're got nothing better to do?  One of the problems with school children is that it's become a crime to discipline them the way our parents were disciplined. There's no spankings, corner times, or sitting on a chair with a dunce cap, because that's all been labeled as abuse to emotional development. Instead we have counseling and the administration of powerful prescription drugs to kids who can barely read.  Kids are spoiled rotten and left unsupervised with TV shows and video games that glorify violence and murdering people for fun. Parents are stuck working two or more jobs just to make enough money for bills so they don't wind up on the streets.  We need massive reform. We gotta go back to how kids were raised in the 50s.

feel_2337	feel	I don't think we have any business forcing anyone to do something they don't want to do. The father is supplying his DNA when he engages in sexual relations. After than point he has in effect signed a blank check. It's like the old saw, if you don't want to do the time, don't do the crime. Fathers to be shouldn't be engaging in sex unless they intend to pony up with the montly check.   I come from a bit of a bias on this subject because this was my area of endeavor for some 20+ years.

They have NO experience with the female anatomy except what they manage to bag, they shouldn't be allowed to decide for us.  They have no idea what pregnancy is like, the damage it does to our bodies and our minds, and they don't have to pay to support a child that we were forced to accept at knifepoint.  Where is the logic is violating women a second time? Where's the justification for it? Doesn't the life of the unintended mother account for anything at all?  Do you men have any idea of the dangerous precdent you'd be setting up with a total ban on abortion? Women who have been raped and essentially told ""You WILL have this child, you WILL carry it to term, or you WILL go to prison!"" would likely commit suicide as a result, meaning that TWO lives are gonna be lost."

feel_2241	feel	Hey - there's plenty of disordered liberal Democrat women badgering conservative men and women tea party participants.

feel_2282	feel	"It is rather disrespectful but don't think it is limited to one side. Most protestors on both sides aren't great.  one thing did spark my interest, and it is said often, why is it a ""hard decision"" if you are pro-choice? Is it hard because you don't know if you want a baby around or not? Couldn't this decision be just as hard before being pregnant? Even so, why link it to going to an abortion clinic? You hear ""It was hard enough to come to this decision in the first place"" but how is going through some protestors making this decision harder?   No one would admit to this but it is statements like ""It was hard enough to come to this decision in the first place"" that make me believe that someone realizes it is wrong and the struggle that makes it hard is whether or not to do the right thing or do they thing that would benefit you the most. And in that case, I agree...that can be a tough decision."
feel_2309	feel	So it's alright for a Evo to insult you and go off on a tangent, and expect to get answer. What's the point in answering if your being mocked, before you give answer. Now I know why there are few Creo's on this forum.

Instead that uncertainty should lead you to stop. If you dont like that example, consider a hunter who is unsure what is in the bushes."
feel_2334	feel	Yet you have defined what unknowable is, therefore you know something of it; that it is unknowable. Not only that, I notice you've leapt away from the claim it doesn't exist.  But then, you must make the assumption that everything is knowable, if there's nothing unknowable. How do you show this? Well so far you've claimed that science MIGHT one day know everything about you. What a hoot.

feel_2254	feel	As much as it pains me I'm going to agree with Mathew here. If you own a private business then you should be able to hire and fire people for whatever reason you want. If a private company only wants to employ one gender that should be their choice. If a private company only wanted to employ people choosing a gay lifestyle, I would support their right to do so. I also support a persons right to not use businesses who have hiring practices they don't agree with.  Note: I don't include gov't in this, the rules are and should be different for government.
feel_2268	feel	And amusingly enough, you who claim you don't have any interest in changing the outcome spend soooo much time posting on these threads...   Perhaps that's another claim that's just false in your opinion? emoticon_rolleyes
feel_2250	feel	"This is different than stating that abortion is the same, in principle, as killing a born child. We are back on the question of ""Why would someone do this horrible thing"" which pro-life people continually ask and has been answered in many ways by many people. There are many threads on the subject :)  That the fetus did not come into existance by it's own choice is really irrelevant. That it did not cause problems of it's own actions does not mean that it does not cause problems."

feel_2253	feel	Well its not much of a religious debate to me when it comes to free will. I believe the Bible fully supports the idea of free will and even assuming that it says nothing at all, based on the way some things go it is hard to believe a good God would not only allow it to happen, but to make it happen is even worse. I mean, what else is there? If we don't have free will and God is the ultimate power, then he must be the one making decisions for us. Can't blame the Devil for everything. Nah I guess you could, but that wouldn't make God sound too good either if he was letting all of his prized creations have their fake lives destroyed by a demon.

I pay as much attention to your demands as I do to knat farts. In fact I'll make it a point to include them.  To sum up your own biased gun grabber group isn't sure exactly where the problem is. Yet even they admit to an enforcement problem. The ATF says its straw purchasers. Not gun owners. Yet you insist its honest people not locking guns up. So far your evidence is scanty to non existant at best. You fail to acknowledge the fault of the criminal element in any way. In short eliminate the criminal from the scene and one could stack guns on the kitchen table safely. Its totally the fault of gun owners for failure to secure. You consistantly fail to acknowledge prior restraint being unconstitutional. It has been demonstrated that your storage idea has led to erosion of civil rights in other countries. Not to mention the very real possiblity of it happening here if your scam is followed. From the gunners seat its nitwits exactly like you in legislature that are the real problem. Now run for the bunker to evade the toxic environment. Your storage scam is shot full of holes.
feel_2327	feel	Well, one can't be truly logical and not be an atheist (or at least agnostic.) As any religion simply flys in the face of logic. Faith and logic are poles apart.      Keep truckin' Jim! Happy weekend to you bro.

feel_2180	feel	"To me, part of the point of the ""please, no scripture"" comment would be to forgo any insistence that we worship God just because the bible says to.  A person could insist that sons pay some form of homage / respect to their father on Father's Fay, but I would argue that it's not reasonable to do so in every case. For example, if the father was physically or sexually abusive, or the father abandoned his children, those would be reasons to fore-go any Father's Day formalities.  And ""God"" could be viewed as the absent father. Suppose we assume that he created the earth and life on the earth. What's his involvement been since then?  Should we worship him just because he's God?  Or, depending upon how one sees God, is God a being unworthy of worship and idolization?  And along those lines, utilizing the Bible as a reference could be a double-edged sword. The ""God"" of the Old Testament ordered slavery, misogyny, genocide, women as spoils of war, ..."

Most of the time, abortion lets women let go of that big weight thats holding them back and prusue their dreams, and live a happy life. Since when has AntiAbortionists cared about women?

feel_2380	feel	you know what..you are right, any unwanted person should be killed. Lets start with nursing homes and then move on to mental health clinics.

This is characteristic of your typical wimpy religious copout and is nothing but a cheep avoidance tactic. These people are not the kind of people that should be making any important decisions that concern other people so I guess itâs just as well. A zygote is no more viable then a sperm. The attempt to call a zygote a living being is simply more evidence that the religious have no common sense.

feel_2186	feel	Thank you for your criticism. :D
feel_2192	feel	Oh, I am just so bothered and annoyed that I can't prove my faith!!! Actually, I'm not really that bothered nor annoyed. I know that all the evidence points to creation, i.e. the creation interpretation makes more sense than the evolutionary interpretation. There is very good evidence to suggest the existence of God, for one, the fact that we are all still here is one. If there were no God, than this whole universe would cease to function. I believe the laws of nature and our sciences are man's attempt to describe the normal ways that God upholds His creation. When He acts differently, a miracle occurs. Of course, this is based on the belief that the Bible is true. Many other great scientists, including Newton and Galileo also seemed to believe that science and Christianity were compatible.   Reason stems from the belief that the universe is orderly, rational and logical. By the dictionary, reason is the intellectual faculty by which conclusions are drawn from premises. Now, if we are accidents of pure chance (which evolution teaches) than the thought patters that determine your logic are also products of chance. If your logic is the result of chance processes, you can't even be sure it evolved properly. This is just to show that with evolution, you can't be sure of anything, because everything is just an accident. But with an orderly and rational Creator, you can be sure of things and be able to reason.
feel_2193	feel	"It is?  If a child grew up never hearing the words religion, gods, spirits, etc. would this child still have faith of some sort?  Is faith some innate human tendency?

Don't play semantics with regard to disability in order to try to catch prochoicers out. It won't wash.  I support elective abortion up to viability, and after viability health/life of mother and severe abnormality of fetus (severe abnormality meaning those conditions that are recognised today as being so severe as to require a late term abortion).  Don't like it? ... TOUGH!  And Phyllis ... its a good idea to let prochoicers answer posts for themselves rather than you imposing what you think are our opinions. If you continue to post prochoicers opinions for them, then you might as well just stand in the mirror and argue with yourself."

You come off sounding more like Archy than you know. Sorry, that's a terrible thing to say to someone, but ...  Simply put, I don't see how this adds any thought to the discussion.
feel_2346	feel	Of course I believe an unborn fetus is simply an unborn child. The only difference is that the unborn has no means of survival without the mother and is not recognized as being a living person. I don't wish that this child should be killed, but as I said before it can be for the best. And if you really do believe in heaven, then the child is going there anyways. Why would you wish a life of suffering on it instead of being able to skip all that and go straight to heaven? This is the type of logic that works against those who believe in a soul since it really doesn't make much sense to live on Earth when heaven is a million billion times better.  Just to answer your question with a question, how do you know a child would choose life over death when it has never lived? People commit suicide everyday but I'm sure they would also choose life over death if they had been in a better situation. Perhaps this is being too extreme. A person would likely choose to live when faced with death, but whether it logically make sense is another question. People will try to live through starvation, sickness, and misery because it is what their mind tells them to do. Is it really best that they are alive?
feel_2226	feel	If I were to become upset merely because you told me the ideas were wrong, you might have a point. But I don't; never have, so far as I recall. An idea can't be stupid, or simple-minded. An idea can be right or wrong, or perhaps partly both. When you describe an idea as stupid, you are saying it is wrong and one would have to be stupid to think that. When you describe an idea as simple minded you are saying it is wrong and one would have to be simple-minded to think that.

So if you want to really have a discussion, start discussing instead of bickering.  Do you think that protesting a Planned Parenthood clinic might have an unintended consequence of discouraging someone from visiting who planned to obtain birth control, (or a Pap smear or other non-abortion service) thereby increasing the likelihood of an unwanted pregnancy (or cervical cancer, etc.)?

Quite frankly, if Christianity insists on trying to tell the government how it should perform marriages, I think that street should cut both ways and the government should be able to have input on how religion performs marriages...  JPSartre12's reply is reflective of the *anti-gay Christians are seeking discrimination against gays, but we're going to try to pretend we're the real victims while we bash them* school of thought.

feel_2219	feel	Well, the slavery analogy for gay rights is past it's applicability at this point--one was a property issue (also rooted in deep prejudice), the other is a morality issue. Many people oppose gay marriage out of morality and NOT prejudice. The same can't be said for slavery. There are many ways that the analogy doesn't work and that's just one of them. In fact, it could as easily be an analogy to reverse it and say that the ones who did the enslaving were analogous to gay rights lobbyists and the abolitionists were analogous to those who seek to protect marriage. After all, the plantation owners were the ones really fighting for ill-conceived rights--rights that they shouldn't have had.

Why would random changes to 3 or 4 of those nucleotides be fatal? They wouldn't.  Besides, our Creationist is trying to make it seem like all of the millions of mutations he references - which is an invalid number - would occur in a single animal?!?!?!??!?! No, the ~1.5 million nucleotide changes in the human lineage (half the nucleotide differences between the chimp and human genomes) would have had about 6 million years to accumulate.  Finally, our Creationists seems to be aware of the fact that humans differ among themselves at about 1 out of every 200 base pairs. By his reasoning, shouldn't we all be dead?
feel_2360	feel	Yes, it does have value only if the woman wants it, in the early stages, when it doesn't have sentience, only potential and DNA. Because then it has value only because of a woman's wants and choices and her dreams for the future. Nothing else gives it value.

feel_2349	feel	Ok, I'm going to have to question your statement as far as this post goes.  I really don't like the fact that you brought out, how African Americans, abort because of poverty, and low education. But white people abort for different reasons.   That is basicly what you said. I find that to be an insult. My cousin, was not poor, nor was she uneducated when she had her abortions. As well as my sister. I think that is some kind of rasist idea that alot of people like to keep as regards to black people. Because I never saw you pin a reason, on why white people abort. But in your mind its understandable. But WOE! To the uneducated black folks! Then you go on to state that black people should in fact take advantage of the higher education, and sports provided for them.  By that statement, it seems to me as if you're implying that black people don't take the oppurtunity to benefit ourselves. Need I remind you, that black people are leading in the sports world. And that there are thousands of black people who are taking advantage of higher learning.  And what is your advice for those who are white, who lead uneducated lives, and abort because of being poor. Believe it or not, there are alot in that situation. So don't you dare classify one race. And assume, they are uneducated, and poor. Thus they have abortions. Expecially since I see that with people of all races. It seems to me like you never took that into consideration.
feel_2215	feel	"Well let me say that so far that you haven't been doing a very good job. My arguments are completely solid, and you haven't even gotten close to refuting them.

An example of my view is that I think that the flood did happen. It all started as a very large flood (probably in a river valley) that was much larger than normal (say a ""500-year-flood"" or a larger discharge event), possibly destroying a bunch of dwellings and maybe killing a lot of people, but some surviving leading to the Noah character. Eventually over the millenia, it got distorted and blown well out of proportion until it became a flood that covered the entire world. Then it led to the Epic of Gilgmesh, which was then adopted by those writing the early books of the Bible under the form it is seen as today."

The final one was overwhelming pro choice prior to her abortion. Attended rallies and everything. SHE felt so bad about havinghte abortion afterwards that 6 months later she blew her head off. She could not get it out of her head that she had killed a baby. She became totally obsessed and finally cracked.

feel_2301	feel	I believe abortion is murder and should be illegal. The only possible circumstance when an abortion should be an option is when the âLIFEâ of both the mother and her unborn child is at risk.

For many of us it is the actual mentally-existing person that is most important.   For both the 'braniac"" case you present and for the early term fetus, if there is no reason to kill it, then don't. However, if there is a contest between the rights of a living, existing person and the rights of either *potential* person, then I think the rights of the living person win out."

Giving specific reasons for gun ownership is the top of a slippery slope towards banning certain firearms.   While I have specific reasons for owning specific guns, to include hunting, I own some of my guns for no other reason than they are fun to shoot.   A humorus side note: I own one gun strictly for fishing, sounds odd but its common practice (at least in Alaska) to shoot large Halibut before bringing them aboard.

fact_3423	fact	"Actually, the debate on this one was hard to miss 8 or 9 years ago. John Woodmorappe, in his book, Noah's Ark: A Feasibility Study, Inst for Creation Research (July 1, 1996), 298 pp., ISBN: 0932766412 did exactly that. Essentially Woodmorappe equated ""kinds"" to genus in most cases, with an occasional family that contained an inordinate number of genera thrown in where he couldn't make all of them fit. Woody came up with 15,754 ""kinds"", and calculates that there would have been enough room on the ark for all of them. He also calculated the room requirements based on the median size of the animals rather than the average size. Of course, he leaves off all plants, arthropods, mollusks, fish, and aquatic mammals. I don't recall if he included the dinosaurs, but Ken Ham, Kent Hovind, Carl Baugh and the like have them on the ark.  You correctly assume that the creationist story would be that there was a ""dog king"" and a ""cat kind"" from which all species evolved in a few years after the flood. Never mind that a single pair of cats could not possibly carry enough genetic diversity to evolve all 36 species of cat in 4 genera, not even in the 4,500 years since the flood was claimed to have occurred. In order to cram all the ""kinds"" on the ark, creationists must leave off everything but mammals and birds (without ever explaining how they could have survived a flood that lasted a year), and then propose hyper-evolution at rates that make evolutionary biologists dizzy, calling it ""variation in kind.""  It should also be noted that ""John Woodmorappe"" is a pen name of Jan Peczkis, a science teacher from Chicago with a degree in earth science. Besides his young earth creationist articles as Woodmorappe, Peczkis has also published old earth articles in peer reviewed literature. At one time Peczkis threatened to sue several people on the internet who revealed the duplicity (one being Joe Meert of the University of Florida geology department. Radiometric Dating, Paleosols and the Geologic Column). If he consulted a lawyer, I'm sure that he was laughed out of the office, since you can't sue someone for slander if what they say is true.

fact_3392	fact	"My stance on morality is based on the following observations:  1. ""I"" for me means my mental self, with my physical self just tagging along.  2. I do not wish to suffer or to have those I care about suffer.  3. I feel empathy toward others and often feel sorry for the suffering of others.  Those are observations, not proclamations.  The way I choose a moral code to avoid the problem of suffering is to essentially make a theoretical deal with others to have a mutual moral code that we will all treat each other as we ourselves would be treated - in this way, all of us can win out and I solve my problem of points 2 and 3. Perhaps there are other better ways of finding a solution for societies to avoid suffering, but I haven't heard of one. I did not choose this solution arbitrarily. I chose it since it makes sense and should theoretically work and since many, if not most people, at least make some effort at using that moral code anyway so this moral code is at least partially universally adopted. It is the best moral option I have ever heard to address my concern about suffering.  What is arbitrary about the reasoning I presented above? What unsupported proclamations do you claim that I have made?  Either way, are you proposing that all moral systems are equally arbitrary and therefore equally valid? In your scenario, someone could come up with an arbitrary proclamation ""black people should be slaves to white people"" and build a morality based on that. My moral approach questions that proclamation as well and thus avoids un-necessary human suffering."

If what was taught in science classes was no more controversial than the freezing point of water or the melting point of lead, then maybe it could be defined in a way that everyone could agree on. But when it gets into theories and hypothesis about one time events that happened thousands, or billions of years ago, its time to set aside what we think science is, and ask ourselves what science class is trying to accomplish. If we take students to a theoretic area where we suspect there is more to be discovered, isn't it time to consider teaching them HOW to think, not WHAT to think? Can we do that by ruling an entire concept out, in a society that exercises free inquiry and advocates progress? Every subject taught in school is different, but science is, (and has to be) about so much more than teaching prior knowledge.  2) Let's look at the dictionary.com definition of religion;

fact_3190	fact	Wow, I hope I'm not the only person who went directly to your source to check it out. Lets review several points here:  1)The need to display current information. This article is almost four years old, I have yet to hear anything about this over the entire course of Mr. Bush's presidency. George W. Bush is one of the most personally assaulted Presidents in US history, few will argue this whether they support him or not. Just about every negative thing Bush has been involved in or people speculate he was involved in has been dragged out and there any number of books with the details. This info has had little or no further data in the past 4 years. The press loves a scandal and I have yet to see them shy away from one as juicy as this if it were true.  2)The need to display information from a reputable source. Just to clarify Flynt is Larry Flynt since you seemed to leave this detail out. This transcript comes from a bulletin board and the sources it cites are at places like gwbushnotmypresident.com and atheist.org I'm sure neither of these websites has an agenda. The end of the post displays an anti-Republican manifesto showing that the person who posted it did it with such impartiality. I'm sure they are focusing on being fair and balanced.  3)Make sure the parts of your source that you don't quote don't contain info that harms your argument. Larry Flynt bases nearly all of this theory on the alleged event of Bush visiting the girl in the hospital after she had an abortion. If this ever did occur there is no evidence that Bush knew that she had an abortion. Flynt says so himself:
fact_3184	fact	Actually, if you look at the example I've given, that's false. The probability of A in one organism may be low, but the probability of A in some organism approaches 100% as the population and the number of generations gets larger. And if A is useful and comes to dominate the population, then the probability of an AB individual appearing then also tends towards 100%. In the example above, the chance of an AB mutant occurring, if A and B are substantially useful mutations, is almost a dead certainty. It would be amazing if they didn't stack. So saying that AB occurring is less likely than A is misleading at best, downright wrong at worst. Behe is clearly misapplying probability theory.
fact_3219	fact	Why is there this onus on the man to do everything? As I said before, it is just as much the woman's choice to have unprotected sex as it is the mans - if this is not the case, then it is already covered by rape laws. By your proposition, only the man need worry about birth control - the woman has no legal necessity to do so at all.  It's not a case that 'the man did the deed' - both parties are potentially just as culpable. If you're going to introduce legal consequences for abortion, they are going to have to affect all the guilty parties; the woman included.   However, personally I would argue against adding further legal restrictions to abortion.

fact_3230	fact	"Again, you are mistaken. ALL of these groups compete for multiple things, and I'll give you real, concrete examples you might even be able to find watching Animal Planet.  1.) Animals compete for mates ALL THE TIME. Have you never seen male lions fighting each other, or elk, hyenas, etc, etc? They fight, the stronger one wins, and the female selects the victor to be her mate, and they produce offspring that likely would grow up to be stronger than those produced by the other male.  2.) Animals compete for resources ALL THE TIME. Nature moves in cycles. Regions experience dry periods, wet periods, cold periods, hot periods, etc. Therefore, viable sources for food fluctuate from season to season. At one point, for example, there may be more predators than prey. With not enough food to go around for entire populations of predators, only those with the ability to go long periods of time without food, or can more effectively find food before other individuals in the population, will survive and those that cannot will likely die. When you get into animals that live in groups (packs, herds, etc.) you will find that competition occurs between these groups. (I am reminded of a famous scene from 2001: A Space Odyssey)  That's really all I have to offer to this debate, hopefully somebody will help verify/strengthen my points, seeing as I'm hardly the expert. supersport, I have been watching your posting strategy, and frankly you seem to be shooting yourself in the foot; most of the things you claim as ""facts"" are downright false.

fact_3224	fact	The 2020 Global Food Outlook answers this as it says that a greater demand for vegetables will correspond with higher prices of vegetables in developing countries. Many articles acknowledge that starving people cannot afford much of any of the food for sale around them, and a greater demand for meat does not necesarily mean a decrease in demand for vegetables as populations grow globally. Since increasing meat consumption is irrational because it will not feed the poor and it will do even more damage to the environment, again, the solution proposed is to support the initiative for developing nations to become more self-sufficient in growing plant foods for themselves.

And it didn't show anything about the frequency of genotypes, because the population has been producing the same moths. If all you can show that a moth population changes colour, then again, then back again how is this anything remotely like evolution?  It is still being taught...  http://www.bethtfiloh.com/biology9pepperedmoth.htm  But it doesn't explain much.  ""Most biologists, however, believe that natural selection is responsible, though no one knows what traits are being selected or what factors in the environment are doing the selecting.""  http://www.arn.org/docs/wells/jw_pepmoth.htm  Another look into this is given at...  http://www.talkdesign.org/faqs/moonshine.htm  All that has been observed is that the population changed colour.

""The peppered moth (Biston betularia (L.)) is a temperate species of night-flying moth notable for its evolution of industrial melanism.""  http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/Peppered-moth  are continually spread. (http://www.millerandlevine.com/km/evol/Moths/moths.html) Cited above argues quite well that we still don't know why - all an evolutionist can say is 'it happened', and 'it happened by evolution'.  It is akin to Darwin giving examples of 'natural selection' by referring to how man breeds animals. In other words, his evidences for natural selection comes from non-natural, purpose driven selection.  Darwin said ""There is no reason why the principles which have acted so efficiently under domestication should not have acted under nature. In the survival of favoured individuals and races, during the constantly-recurrent Struggle for Existence, we see a powerful and ever-acting form of Selection.""  http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/Origin/origin_15.html  The phrase 'survival of the fittest' was not even Darwin's. It was urged on him by Wallace, the codiscoverer of natural selection, who hated 'natural selection' because he thought it implied that something was doing the selecting. Darwin coined the term 'natural selection' because had made an analogy with 'artificial selection' as done by breeders, an analogy Wallace hadn't made when he developed his version of the theory. The phrase 'survival of the fittest' was originally due to Herbert Spencer some years before the Origin  http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/evolphil/tautology.html  And this sort of thing continues today in modern textbooks.  ""From time to time, attacks on neo-Darwinism are mounted, usually by persons who either see evolutionary theory as antireligious or who basically misunderstand Darwin's theory. One attack, entitled ""Darwin's Mistakes,"" by Tom Bethell, was published in Harper's magazine.  Bethell began by pointing out that Darwinian theory is a tautology rather than a predicative theory. (The term tautology means a statement that is true by definition.)* That is, evolution is the survival of the fittest. But who are the fittest? Obviously, the individuals who survive. Thus, without an independent criterion for fitness, other than survival, we are left with the statement that evolution is the survival of the survivors. This indeed is a tautology. But it is possible to assign independent criteria for fitness. Darwin wrote extensively about artificial selection in pigeons, in which the breeders' choice was the criterion for fitness. (Many novel breeds of pigeon have been created this way.) Artificial selection has been practiced extensively by plant and animal breeders. Here too, survival is not the criterion for fitness, productivity is.""  Robert H Tamarin, (1996) ""Principles of Genetics"" (5th ed), p571."

fact_3391	fact	"And can you provide a citation from the Constitution that supports the notion that a President can send the military half-way round the world without a declaration of war from Congress?  Come now. To call an issue ""settled law"" is, as someone else pointed out, to emphasize stare decisis, i.e. ""to stand by what has been decided,"" i.e. to recognize the binding nature of precedent. This is why, in those rare cases where long-standing precedents are overturned, it's such a big deal: the court essentially admits that it had been wrong.  As to so-called ""judicial activism"" -- and again as someone else pointed out -- to emphasize stare decisis is preciesly the opposite of ""judicial activism."" With regard to Roe itself, what I find remarkable is that the court exercised so much restraint: the justices explicitly refused to make a declaration about when life begins. They explicitly claimed not to have any qualifications to make such a decision, and they noted that even those who examine the issue thoroughly -- scientists and physicians, theologians and philosophers -- are nowhere near a consensus on the matter. So they decided not step in and settle such metaphysical questions.  Indeed, it is ultimately individuals whom the court allowed to make this decision as they see fit. And so, they based the decision on the right to privacy. Said right is not explicit in the Constitution, but that doesn't matter (see the Ninth Amendment for why). And said right is also not absolute (as the decision again explicitly says): it is limited in this case by the state's compelling interest in protecting prenatal life (a point which is often overlooked by all sides in the abortion debate), and that interest is directly proportional to the viability of the fetus. But what Roe clarified is that any law establishing the protection of prenatal life as an unconditional trump of the mother's right to privacy is unconstitutional. Within reasonable limits, she herself gets to decide when life begins, and to act accordingly.  Like I said, judicial restraint. And a stunning example of defending the individual from government interference or social discrimination in matters of conscience, to boot."

Some of the best ""man tracks"" were found by removing the soil on top of the slab. Some of the tracks were only the shallow impression of the middle part of the tridactyl print. Mr. Carl Baugh claimed these were human tracks. He convinced John Morris of the ICR. After these tracks had been exposed for about 10 years, Glen Kuban invited John Morris back to look again. In some of those tracks the softer infill has since eroded to show clearly the tridactyl nature of the tracks. In others, the infill has changed color by being exposed to the river water. The outline of the entire track is vivible in the stone. John Morris now agrees that there is no track in the river that was made by a human.  I am amazed that you went to visit this river and didn't go inside the Park Headquarters. They have a very nice display that explains the history. Also there are signs at various points of access to the river with signs with information. How is it that you paid attention to none of it.

Natural selection is dependant upon which individuals will pass their genetic information on to the next generation, and that is determined by at least two factors that I can think of at the moment: 1.) An individual being able to survive long enough to find a mate, and 2.) Actually being able to find a mate and produce offspring, which brings me to my next point:

That doesn't mean one group automatically has to die so we remain at the same number of species.  Of course, one group might get some significant advantage which allows it to come back and ownzor the original area so the other group gets wiped out.

It is always possible to separate one from their argument. Attack the argument and not the person. Again - that is just one of the logical fallacies.

Scientists get to define what they mean by the scientific words that they use. Not you and not your preacher. Do I get to define what you mean by the word ""prayer?"" Why not?"
fact_3196	fact	"Though I am jumping into the discussion here and have not followed it from the beginning, I need to address yours points.  I get the impression that you view women as having a responsibility over their offspring from the point of conception on - i.e. not only in late term. I would contest this. Up to around the beginning of the third trimester, the embryo / fetus is nothing but a developing body with ""nobody home"" - i.e. no mental existence (no thoughts, no emotions, no sense of self, no feelings of pain, no ability to experience their environment - nothing). I do not see any reason to have forced responsibility over such a living mindless body. As at the end of life when the mind can be gone from accident or illness, it is not worth keeping the empty living body artificially alive. It is the person who effectively resides in the body (through mental brain function or belief in a soul) who we value - not the body itself.   From discussions with those on the pro-life side, it seems clear that the thing that is valued in the embryo / early fetus is not as much what it currently IS but what it WILL BECOME. What it currently IS is only valued because it is on its way to becoming something / someone that we do value. The hypothetical question to test this was how much is such a life valued if it suddenly stopped growing so that it would never reach the stage of lifeform that has emotions, thoughts, feelings of pain, etc. Apparently, its value dropped significantly (at least that was the answer for those not afraid of anwering that question).  However, once there is ""somebody home"" in that body, then I would agree that you now have another person whose rights should be taken into account. Biologically, neurologically speaking, such mental functions can't start before around the beginning of the third trimester. So, I support more clearly legally restricting third trimester abortion rights to the limited exceptions (mother's life, significant risk to health, mercy killing deformed fetuses, etc.). Then it makes sense to speak of an ""other"" to whom one has responsibilities.  One last point. I have heard a few pro-life advocates make the same arguement you do that pro-choice supporters make their arguements simply out of a ""defense rationalization"", where you think they really do agree that they are doing wrong. You don't realize that they actually generally do believe all of what they say. As a general rule of thumb, I tend to think that most people believe what they say. However, many people have holes or inconsistencies in their thinking that one can highlight if one can tell what those holes or inconsistencies are. I have found that the best way to discover such holes and inconsistencies in reasoning is to see what type of questions people make an effort at avoiding to answer. Where the pro-life camp is concerned, I find that a major hole in their reasoning is to highlight what the embryo / early fetus is AT THAT MOMENT , independent of what it will become in the future. This has highlighted that it is only valued by what it WILL BECOME, not for what it currently IS. As for the extreme pro-choice side that would allow abortions at all times for any reason (note: they represent a minority of the pro-choice side), then they get very uncomfortable when you question them about the difference in a fetus one day from birth vs a newborn baby and force them to answer the question of whether or not they would allow a birth-minus-one-day abortion for any reason.  So, instead of jumping to wrong assumptions about the reasoning of pro-choice supporters, search for holes in logic and reasoning that you can exploit. That would be far more effective than your false assumptions that they are harboring guilt."
fact_3237	fact	And the state... States can have armies... The people are the Militia.
fact_3223	fact	"Actually you are incorrect. I have heard this explanation before and at the risk of being rude its given by people who don't actually under stand what is meant by ""testing a theory."" You can not successfully test a theory. Once a theory has been successfully tested it is no longer a theory. When sceince refers to testing a theory it's a process of creating an experiment using what they do know to find out what they don't know, but it never proves the theory. It can often find another peice of the puzzle that when theorized can help support the theory, but that is not surprising given the theory was used as the experimental modul.   As such the tests only provide additional information (or education) for the educational guess. Unfortuantly mathmatics and sceince use testing a theory in different ways and the layaman often confuses the two.   In Mathematics it is possible to test and retest using different mathematical variables and come up with numerous examples of success and it still be a theory. The reason for this is that mathematics in itself is theoretical. By that meaning it is non-physical and can only be approximated. However such is not the case for science.   I would not go so far as claim you are being equivocative because I think itâs ignorance not misrepresentation on your part. However, Thatâs the last I will talk about the term theory either people can accept the definition or not. Even if they disagree if they can not discuss within that frame work quite frankly they probably arenât at the educational/critical level to discuss the concepts.  If someone wants to prove me wrong simply give me a scientific theory that has been successfully tested."

The topic of this thread is ""15 myths about gun control"" But you seem unable to make a logical point so you resort to attacking the individual...  Significant portions of this article are excerpted from Michael Z. Williamson's excellent and witty piece, It's amazing what one has to believe to believe in gun control""   1. Banning guns works, which is why New York, DC, & Chicago cops need guns.  2. Washington DC's low murder rate of 69 per 100,000 is due to strict gun control, and Indianapolis' high murder rate of 9 per 100,000 is due to the lack of gun control.  3. Statistics showing high murder rates justify gun control but statistics showing increasing murder rates after gun control are ""just statistics.""  4. The Brady Bill and the Assault Weapons Ban, both of which went into effect in 1994 are responsible for the decrease in violent crime rates, which have been declining since 1991.  5. We must get rid of guns because a deranged lunatic may go on a shooting spree at any time and anyone who would own a gun out of fear of such a lunatic is paranoid.  6. The more helpless you are the safer you are from criminals.  7. An intruder will be incapacitated by tear gas or oven spray, but if shot with a .357 Magnum will get angry and kill you.  8. A woman raped and strangled is morally superior to a woman with a smoking gun and a dead rapist at her feet.  9. When confronted by violent criminals, you should ""put up no defense -- give them what they want, or run"" (Handgun Control Inc. Chairman Pete Shields, Guns Don't Die - People Do, 1981, p.125).  10. The New England Journal of Medicine is filled with expert advice about guns; just like Guns & Ammo has some excellent treatises on heart surgery.  11. One should consult an automotive engineer for safer seatbelts, a civil engineer for a better bridge, a surgeon for internal medicine, a computer programmer for hard drive problems, and Sarah Brady for firearms expertise.  12. The 2nd Amendment, ratified in 1787, refers to the National Guard, which was created 130 years later, in 1917.  13. The National Guard, federally funded, with bases on federal land, using federally-owned weapons, vehicles, buildings and uniforms, punishing trespassers under federal law, is a ""state"" militia.  14. These phrases: ""right of the people peaceably to assemble,"" ""right of the people to be secure in their homes,"" ""enumerations herein of certain rights shall not be construed to disparage others retained by the people,"" and ""The powers not delegated herein are reserved to the states respectively, and to the people"" all refer to individuals, but ""the right of the people to keep and bear arm"" refers to the state.  15. ""The Constitution is strong and will never change."" But we should ban and seize all guns thereby violating the 2nd, 4th, and 5th Amendments to that Constitution.  16. Rifles and handguns aren't necessary to national defense! Of course, the army has hundreds of thousands of them.  17. Private citizens shouldn't have handguns, because they aren't ""military weapons"", but private citizens shouldn't have ""assault rifles"", because they are military weapons.  18. In spite of waiting periods, background checks, finger printing, government forms, etc., guns today are too readily available, which is responsible for recent school shootings. In the 1940's, 1950's and1960's, anyone could buy guns at hardware stores, army surplus stores, gas stations, variety stores, Sears mail order, no waiting, no background check, no fingerprints, no government forms and there were no school shootings.  19. The NRA's attempt to run a ""don't touch"" campaign about kids handling guns is propaganda, but the anti-gun lobby's attempt to run a ""don't touch"" campaign is responsible social activity.  20. Guns are so complex that special training is necessary to use them properly, and so simple to use that they make murder easy.  21. A handgun, with up to 4 controls, is far too complex for the typical adult to learn to use, as opposed to an automobile that only has 20.  22. Women are just as intelligent and capable as men but a woman with a gun is ""an accident waiting to happen"" and gun makers' advertisements aimed at women are ""preying on their fears.""  23. Ordinary people in the presence of guns turn into slaughtering butchers but revert to normal when the weapon is removed.  24. Guns cause violence, which is why there are so many mass killings at gun shows.  25. A majority of the population supports gun control, just like a majority of the population supported owning slaves.  26. Any self-loading small arm can legitimately be considered to be a ""weapon of mass destruction"" or an ""assault weapon.""  27. Most people can't be trusted, so we should have laws against guns, which most people will abide by because they can be trusted.  28. The right of Internet pornographers to exist cannot be questioned because it is constitutionally protected by the Bill of Rights, but the use of handguns for self defense is not really protected by the Bill of Rights.  29. Free speech entitles one to own newspapers, transmitters, computers, and typewriters, but self-defense only justifies bare hands.  30. The ACLU is good because it uncompromisingly defends certain parts of the Constitution, and the NRA is bad, because it defends other parts of the Constitution.  31. Charlton Heston, a movie actor as president of the NRA is a cheap lunatic who should be ignored, but Michael Douglas, a movie actor as a representative of Handgun Control, Inc. is an ambassador for peace who is entitled to an audience at the UN arms control summit.  32. Police operate with backup within groups, which is why they need larger capacity pistol magazines than do ""civilians"" who must face criminals alone and therefore need less ammunition.  33. We should ban ""Saturday Night Specials"" and other inexpensive guns because it's not fair that poor people have access to guns too.  34. Police officers have some special Jedi-like mastery over hand guns that private citizens can never hope to obtain.  35. Private citizens don't need a gun for self-protection because the police are there to protect them even though the Supreme Court says the police are not responsible for their protection.  36. Citizens don't need to carry a gun for personal protection but police chiefs, who are desk-bound administrators who work in a building filled with cops, need a gun.  37. ""Assault weapons"" have no purpose other than to kill large numbers of people. The police need assault weapons. You do not.  38. When Microsoft pressures its distributors to give Microsoft preferential promotion, that's bad; but when the Federal government pressures cities to buy guns only from Smith & Wesson, that's good.  39. Trigger locks do not interfere with the ability to use a gun for defensive purposes, which is why you see police officers with one on their duty weapon.  40. Handgun Control, Inc. says they want to ""keep guns out of the wrong hands."" Guess what? You have the wrong hands"

fact_3368	fact	"Hello, Nu Leader.  Nor was the peppered moth example ever meant to ""prove"" evolution. One important part of the theory of evolution is the hypothesis that natural selection is the major driving force behind it. So, the peppered moth observations were meant to show that natural selection can have a significant effect on the relative frequency of genotypes.  Incidentally, I am interested in your comment that natural selection is consistent with creationism. It was Darwin who first proposed that natural selection can be the major force driving the evolution of species. Creationists pretty much tried to discredit natural selection for over a century. It was only after scientific evidence was presented that showed decisively that natural selection was, indeed, a major contributor to evolution that creationists were finally forced to accept it.  I would be interested in know who was the first creationist to finally accept that natural selection is a real phenomenon, and when they accepted it."

fact_3209	fact	No, Christianity holds that Jesus IS God.       That Jesus also is NOT God just shows how contradictory the Bible is for Christians (but they overlook logic and hold blindly to their silly trinity position anyway).
fact_3235	fact	And thus, pro-choicer are more mathematical and scientifical. We are more logical than the pro-lifers, and just don't blindly make assumptions about human life, because of its consequences.

fact_3180	fact	Oh boy, trying to tie Bayesian statistics to the number of assumptions! Nowhere in Bayesian analysis is there a term for number of assumptions.  Once again you are trying to tie number of assumptions to the correctness of a hypothesis. There is no such connection. It doesn't exist. In science, you only use data to evaluate hypotheses. In Bayesian analysis, each study represents more DATA, not a change in assumptions.
fact_3194	fact	Nice job not addressing anything I said.  I am not a radical, just informed. I used to work for a sexual violence center and counseled rape victims in college. I am also a victim. Keeping myself up to date on sex crimes is important to me, partly because I want all that can be done to prevent it done. Pointing a finger at gays like this does not do that.   This pyschologist sums it up nicely:  http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/rainbo...lestation.html
fact_3143	fact	logic would lead one to believe abortion is wrong...but why be consistent in your thinking.  The point is, logic and rational thinking is not a requirement to make a law. You can ban abortion is you want...the states did it and the constitution allows it, even if 5 legislatures think otherwise.

fact_3382	fact	"of course he says ""might"", science always tentative. any time you see something along the lines of ""it happened this way"" there is always an implied, but unseen ""probably"" between the ""it"" and the ""happened"".  Look... you made a comment about how Dawkin's observation that the eye is flawed is actually support ID because it actually justifies a creationist's argument that it's ok to look for well designed aspects. I responded by putting your accusation in context (He was criticizing Paley, and he never actually used this as evidence, just showing that it could go both ways).   Now you go off on a tangent about how dawkinsâ logic is flawed, and how behe's logic is accurate... i don't want to get into that because, both dawkinsâ and behe's make much better arguments themselves (anyone reading, go out and get these booksâ¦ behe is much more technical and raises some questions that must be answered, however makes (imo) some unwarranted conclusions at the end of his book. Dawkins is much less technical, however provides logical reasoning as to why evolution is possible and how it works)  but i do want to point out that while this is an example of 2 different interpretations (good/bad designs in the eye) given the same thing, it is NOT used as any kind of scientific proof of anything. opinions are not objective scientific evidence because they are subjective."
fact_3396	fact	"**  The darwinian notion has had no payoff. The fact of evolution, as descent with modification from one or a few common ancestors, predates darwin by hundreds of years, and is not the private property of materialism/mechanism/darwinism.  The real ""payoffs come from 2 sources--the understanding of inheritance that grew out of Mendel's inheritance theory, and the concept of dynamic systemic 'adaptation', as opposed to passive particulate 'selection', in evoltion.  Have to go now."

fact_3341	fact	"In other words, you think a Supreme Court decision should only shut down the debate if it's a decision you agree with. Roe v. Wade and Heller do share some striking similarities. For example, Scalia stated in Heller:   ""Nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on long-standing prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms.""  However, the text of the Constitution has as much to say about such restrictions as it does about abortion. I've heard that Scalia has been criticized for making such a statement because there is no clear historical precedent dating back 200 years of banning felons from owning firearms. So neither the text of the Second Amendment nor tradition justifies such restrictions. It is an example of judicial lawmaking."

fact_3454	fact	So why cannot juvenile crimes which would otherwise be death penalty eligible be treated on a case-by-case basis? Under the theory of variable neurophysiological development, we could suppose that some individuals under 18 will have a fully developed moral understanding, and also some individuals 18 and over who do not.
fact_3440	fact	Because there are people who are trying to deny the theory of evolution it's place as a vital part of public school's biology curriculum.
fact_3326	fact	Yes, because congresses powers are actually pretty limited. It hink it will be interesting to see how the 2 upcoming supreme court cases (one has already been accepted, the other is pretty much a shoe in) regarding the commerce clause will be handled, since the majority of the laws that congress passes are tied to it.
fact_3130	fact	"And that remark is relevant because? Just to inform you once again, the word is ""stasis."" You make yourself look ignorant and foolish when you can't even spell correctly. However, stasis is the norm in a stable environment. The reasons are simple. Organisms tend to become well adapted to a stable environment. As Richard Dawkins would explain, they tend to become adapted to a particular nich in a particular environment, and when that environment undergoes rapid change, they go extinct. The fossil record is full of such examples. Dawkins used the analogy of climbing a mountain of adaptation that made it impossible for the organism to cross to the peak of the new environment. Try reading ""Climbing Mount Improbable"" for an understanding."
fact_3124	fact	Again, how so? If you can grip a tree with a birds foot and climb it while your preadator can't would be a great advantage. Likewise, a predator who can climb trees and get at the food sources up there would have a advantage over your competition.  Ostriches and other flightless birds seem to get along just fine with their feet. Why would you say they were suffering from a detriment?
fact_3246	fact	Yes. That is one component of evolutionary thought. But there is more to it than that. Another component of evolutionary thought is that many times species remain static (as far as the fossil record reveals) for long periods of time, sometimes millions of years. Another component of evolutionary thought is that sometimes speciation can happen relatively rapidly, in a flash of geological time, maybe as little as 50 or 60 thousand years. Even Darwin hypothesized that changes that caused speciation took place in peripheral segments of the population. Just before World War II Dobzhansky and Mayr discussed the gaps in the fossil record and the reasons for them. They agreed with Darwin. Finally, in the 1960s Eldredge and Gould worked out the first statement of what became the theory of punctuated equilibria in which they elaborated on the previous thoughts of Darwin, Dobzhansky, and Mayr. I think their paper, in which they discussed their observations from the fossil record of just such events, was published in 1972.
fact_3252	fact	Because what inspired my argument/debate challange was the Questions for both sides thread, it was full of vague/popular laymans usages of the term, and you canât blame only me for it, since I didn't start the thread, and since I was only about 1/10 of all the broad usages of the term going on in that thread, the rest were coming from evolutionists. Please read its opening post (by an evolutionist) â youâre not going to find much about biology there.

fact_3253	fact	"Well, I can more easily explain what it is NOT.  In my latter ID days, I was arguing for a form of Directed Panspermia, with the aliens themselves having arisen by purely natural means - starting off as simpler organisms than us, but then evolving intelligence - and then creating life as we know it. Without getting into details, imagine what we humans will probably due in 100 years or so: create a new form of life (robotic) that is vastly different than our own and probably more complex. And it is a form of life we would be more likely to send out into space than ourselves, and that is better suited for being send out to other planets than we are. Analogously, imagine a form of alien life unlike that as we know it creating bacterial life and then sending it out in spaceships to populate other worlds. With our form of life being designed by a different form of life and rocketed here, that would be intelligent design of life as we know it.  However, that is NOT what the ID movement holds ID to be: their's is a religious position down to its core, as became even more clear in the Dover, PA court case.  Also, one could argue that Intelligent Design is a fact. When humans create a novel amino acid sequence, or modify a bacterium to perform a specific target function, then we are practicing intelligent design in biology. But that is NOT what the ID movement means. Theirs is a religious position that uses human design as an analogy, not as their goal.  As far as Behe's ID, he made it clear in his Darwins' Black Box and in court in the Dover, PA case that he can't say much of anything about ID. He can't tell WHEN the designs were created, HOW the designs were instantiated, by WHOM or ""WHOMS"" the designs were created, or WHERE the designs and instantiations occurred. He's got 0 details. Yet he rejects evolution - despite the tons of evidence - because not every single I has been dotted in the origin of the bacterial flagellum. Behe strains out a gnat yet swallows a camel."
fact_3247	fact	"Really. Please cite where Darwin discussed ""Macro Evolution."" What paper or book, and what chapter? What did he say about it that is hilarious. Have you actually read Darwin? Perhaps his paper on earth worms? Or maybe his paper on the formation of coral islands? I haven't read either of those or most of his other works. But I happen to have a copy of On The Origin Of Species and I can't find any discussion of ""Macro Evolution"". I even have an electronic version of Origin and a search of the text gives zero hits on ""Macro Evolution"" or ""macroevolution"" or even ""macro-evolution."" In fact, there are zero hits on ""evolution."""

fact_3443	fact	"They affect you too.  I must quote again...  ""The current controversy is largely a reflection of different scientific philosophies, linked to ideas about race through their treatment of variation. But there is more to it. Even if they have no conscious social agenda, scientists are bound by the same preconceptions as everyone else - their social, religious, and educational backgrounds influence their choices of theories and, perhaps more important, their philosophies of science. Karl Popper noted more than once that it doesn't matter where hypotheses come from, only whether they explain the evidence they are based on, wether they are subject to disproof, and whether they can hold up to enthusiastic attempts to disprove them. This philosophy forms the basis of deductive science. But hypothesis do come from somewhere, often the underlying assumptions of society. Moreover, not only the differences in sources of ideas, but also different premises scientists have held about evolution, human nature, God, and how science should be done, have always underscored the controversies about human evolution.""  Wolpoff, M & Caspari, R, (1997) ""Race and Human Evolution: A Fatal Attraction"", p12.  I have been at pains to quote this, not because their work is in the field of epistemology (for when I post evidence, from epistemological sources, I get the reaction I just got from you; 'too much information'/'irrelevant to scientists!' These evolutionists recognise the variety of influences, not all affecting us all on a conscious level. You simply ignore this evidence and present a statement that you don't believe it.  Further I find it odd people should demand that I cease quoting from outside sources to back up my statements."
fact_3457	fact	So you're blaming America's higher murder rate than other developed nations on poor police work and the criminal justice system? America already has a higher incarceration rate than other developed nations. Gun activists keep telling us we need to lock more people up and keep them locked up for longer. If that's the standard by which criminal justice systems can be evaluated then America is doing a better job. So how can the difference in murder rates be blamed on America's criminal justice system?

fact_3244	fact	"Except for possible exception of a couple evangelistic atheists, the design argument is from the creationist side. It is pretty old being first stated by William Paley. Darwin respected Paley and thought his arguments beautiful until he actually started looking at reality (Darwin also lived in that same rooms at Christ's College, Cambridge that Paley did). The argument from design is presented as ""proof"" of God or an ""intelligent"" designer for those who want to pretend that intelligent design creationism ins't creationism. But the argument on the other side is that it is flawed design and therefore isn't ""proof"". Evolutionary biologists don't assert that there is not god, only that there is no evidence from nature that there is one.  Science is naturalistic. Even if some scientists (and others) are philosophical naturalists, science doesn't work that way. It is methodological naturalism simply because there are no tools by which science can examine or quantify the supernatural. It sounds silly when some claim that scientists are wrong when they fail to consider the supernatural in naturalism."
fact_3250	fact	It has a chance. Any scientist has the opportunity to study ID. We are discussing the science classroom. We already teach it as a hypothesis in most schools. But it simply should not be taught as a valid alternative to evolution. That's what this debate is over.
fact_3278	fact	Actually, it depends on what you are comparing and how you want to characterize certain phenomena.  If you are comparing only coding sequence, then it is on the order of 99%. If you are comparing coding and noncoding sequence, it is on the order of 97-98%. If you consider indels not as one-time events that incorporate large-scale changes of sequence, but count the individual nuclotides within each indel, then it comes out to 94-95%.  What the creationists never seem to understand is that if you are goiong to adopt the comparison method in which indels are treated as colelctions of nuclotide changes rather than one-time events, ALL % similarities between ALL taxa will be lowered somewhat.  This means that when they predictably trot out some bastardized version of Haldane's dilemma claiming that the nmew lower similarity is even harder for evolution to explain, they do not realize how devastating this method of accounting is for creationism genetics.  For now the 'increased dissimilarity' has to be accounted for in the very short time frames allowed by biblically-constrained science - about 4,500 years instead of the hundreds of thousands or millions of years during which accumulations of DNA change can be accounted for.  So desperate are they ro 'diss Darwin' that they don't recognize the problems their arguments cause for their own ideology.  That or they don't care.

The Federal Civil Rights Act guarantees all people the right to ""full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, and accommodations of any place of public accommodation, without discrimination or segregation on the ground of race, color, religion, or national origin.""    If the reason a pharmacy kook is refusing service based on their belief that doing so is contrary to their religious beliefs (or that they are supporting a behavior that is considered bad in their religion), then is it not clearly illegal?  The grey area is of course if they lie and say it's not religion, it's just ""ethics"", or ""whim"". In that case it may not be illegal, but if I got that in writing, that my employee was refusing to take customers based on their own person ethics or on a whim, it makes it easy to fire them since it's already established that they are being fired for reasons other than illegal reasons (race/religion/color, etc.)  Up to the courts I suppose. Personally I would feel discriminated against, and ""morality"" is easily linked to religion (especially in these cases). If I were discriminated against on religious grounds I'd feel I have a pretty good case (not necessarily a good chance of winning in this christian/ignorant nation).  -Mach"
fact_3324	fact	Sure, but then you get into all sorts of problems of classifications, slippery slopes, and other awkward messes.

And you consider this a rational argument? Here's another quote from your link: Fistulas are a scourge of the poor, affecting two million women and girls, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia    So tell us, PLEASE!!! How is this an argument which justifies abortions in America where Fistulas is virtually unknown as a result of child birth? Tell me how this quoted section below applies to any aspect of medical care in the USA.  The women filled most of Ward 2, a long, one-story building with a cement floor and two rows of closely spaced beds against opposite walls. All had suffered from obstructed labor, meaning that their babies were too big or in the wrong position to pass through the birth canal. If prolonged, obstructed labor often kills the baby, which may then soften enough to fit through the pelvis, so that the mother delivers a corpse.  Obstructed labor can kill the mother, too, or crush her bladder, uterus and vagina between her pelvic bones and the babyâs skull. The injured tissue dies, leaving a fistula: a hole that lets urine stream out constantly through the vagina. In some cases, the rectum is damaged and stool leaks out. Some women also have nerve damage in the legs.  One of the most striking things about the women in Ward 2 was how small they were. Many stood barely five feet tall, with slight frames and narrow hips, which may have contributed to their problems. Girls not fully grown, or women stunted by malnutrition, often have small pelvises that make them prone to obstructed labor.

fact_3254	fact	Well, we can go through a list from Live human sacrifice, infraticide, slavery in the Roman empire, to sexual morality, and the treatment of Wmen - Mother's and their children.  We might need a new thread for this topic!  Most elucidating, and worth quoting is:  In the Syballine Oracles, written by an Egyptian Jew probably between 163 and 45 B.C., the author compared Jews to the other nations: The Jews   âare mindful of holy wedlock, and they do not engage in impious intercourse with male children, as do Phoenicians, Egyptians, and Romans, specious Greece and many nations of others, Persians and Galatians and all Asia.â   And in our times, sex historian Amo Karlen wrote that according to the sex researcher Alfred Kinsey, âHomosexuality was phenomenally rare among Orthodox Jews.â   To a world which divided human sexuality between penetrator and penetrated, Judaism said, âYou are wrong â sexuality is to be divided between male and female.â   To a world which saw women as baby producers unworthy of romantic and sexual attention, Judaism said, âYou are wrong â women must be the sole focus of men's erotic love.â   To a world which said that sensual feelings and physical beauty were life's supreme goods, Judaism said, âYou are wrong â ethics and holiness are the supreme goods.â   A thousand years before Roman emperors kept naked boys, Jewish kings were commanded to write and keep a sefer torah, a book of the Torah. ....nothing moved me more than the Talmudic law that Jews were forbidden to sell slaves or sheep to non-Jews, lest the non-Jews engage in homosexuality and bestiality. That was the world in which rabbis wrote the Talmud, and in which, earlier, the Bible was written. Asked what is the single greatest revelation I have derived from all my researches, I always respond,   i âThat there had to have been divine revelation to produce the Torah.â   The Torah was simply too different from the rest of the world, too against man's nature, to have been solely man-made.   The creation of Western civilization has been a terribly difficult and unique thing. It took a constant delaying of gratification, and a re-channeling of natural instincts; and these disciplines have not always been well received. There have been numerous attempts to undo Judeo-Christian civilization, not infrequently by Jews (through radical politics) and Christians (through anti-Semitism).   The bedrock of this civilization, and of Jewish life, has been the centrality and purity of family life. But the family is not a natural unit so much as it is a value that must be cultivated and protected. The Greeks assaulted the family in the name of beauty and Eros. The Marxists assaulted the family in the name of progress.   Judaismâs Sexual Revolution: Why Judaism (and then Christianity) Rejected Homosexuality - Click Here
fact_3240	fact	"Well, your question doesn't need the macro bit in there as evolution happens or it doesn't, the ""macro"" bit is once again an artifact of our view on the world (ie. our short lives make it rather difficult to see evolution shape anything other than the organisms with the fastest of reproductive cycles.) Given we have evidence of life (fossils) changing over time (radiometric dating and stratigraphy) we know it takes many of thousands, if not millions of years for noticable to-the-eye changes in animals to occur. Once again it is important to consider perspective- we only have the equivalent of a few frames (fossils) from the movie of life (geological time) and there is much that is lost to history forever. Still, enough remains to support evolution, unless you were to purposefully disregard the facts we find.  On your final point it is rather out of context, and I suspect not accidentally so. I'm not sure what on earth consitutes ""convincing evidence"" for any philosphical outlook on life, be it theistic or otherwise."

The Canid species, specifically the Gray Wolf, or the Canis lupus which the domesticated dog is an extremely close relative of, differing from it by at most 0.2% of mtDNA sequence.  The evolution of the domestic dog   The earliest remains of the domestic dog date from 10 to15 thousand years ago21; the diversity of these remains suggests multiple domestication events at different times and places. Dogs may be derived from several different ancestral gray wolf populations, and many dog breeds and wild wolf populations must be analysed in order to tease apart the genetic sources of the domestic dog gene pool. A limited mtDNA restriction fragment analysis of seven dog breeds and 26 gray wolf populations from different locations around the world has shown that the genotypes of dogs and wolves are either identical or differ by the loss or gain of only one or two restriction sites22. The domestic dog is an extremely close relative of the gray wolf, differing from it by at most 0.2% of mtDNA sequence.  In comparrison, the gray wolf differs from its closest wild relative, the coyote, by about 4% of mitochondrial DNA sequence14 (Fig. 4). Therefore, the molecular genetic evidence does not support theories that domestic dogs arose from jackal ancestors24. Dogs are gray wolves, despite their diversity in size and proportion; the wide variation in their adult morphology probably results from simple changes in developmental rate and timing 25.

They consist now of the whole people, except a few public officers.""145   * Virginia Constitution, Art. I, Sec. 13 (1776): ""That a well-regulated militia, composed of the body of the people, trained to arms, is the proper, natural, and safe defense of a free State; that standing armies, in time of peace, should be avoided, as dangerous to liberty....""   * Richard Henry Lee: ""To preserve liberty, it is essential that the whole body of the people always possess arms, and be taught alike, especially when young, how to use them .... The mind that aims at a select militia [like the National Guard], must be influenced by a truly anti-republican principle.""146   2. U.S. Congress   * The Militia Act of 1792. One year after the Second Amendment was added to the Constitution, Congress passed a law defining the militia. The Militia Act of 1792 declared that all free male citizens between the ages of 18 and 44 were to be members of the militia. Furthermore, every citizen was to be armed. The Act stated:   ""Every citizen... [shall] provide himself with a good musket, or firelock, a sufficient bayonet and belt, two spare flints....""147   The Militia Act of 1792 made no provision for any type of select militia such as the National Guard.   * U.S. Senate Subcommittee Report (1982). ""In the Militia Act of 1792, the second Congress defined 'militia of the United States' to include almost every free adult male in the United States. These persons were obligated by law to possess a [military-style] firearm and a minimum supply of ammunition and military equipment.... There can be little doubt from this that when the Congress and the people spoke of the a 'militia,' they had reference to the traditional concept of the entire populace capable of bearing arms, and not to any formal group such as what is today called the National Guard.""148   * Current Federal Law: 10 U.S.C.

fact_3447	fact	Yes. It is also a classic example of a creationist straw man. It demonstrates that you haven't bothered to learn the most basic ideas of the topic and that you are willing to let some creationist hack dupe you. The methods of dating fossils was first developed by creationists when they discovered that certain suites of fossils were always found in the same order in geological strata. They reasoned that the deeper the fossils were, the older they were. Thus, they assigned relative ages to certain types of strata. Of course, their estimates of actual age were way off, since they thought that the earth was only a few million years old. We now have several methods of radiometric dating and can more accurately determine the ages of fossils. The relative dating methods of the creationist scientists has been confirmed - the dates are just older than they thought.

Please don't write your rebuttal before reading this post.  What I'm saying is that one nucleotide can make a difference in whether an organism survives or does not survive. For example, let's consider penguins and the Galapagos. Now, it is a well known fact that the Galapagos were formed relatively recently. Before then, it is generally accepted that penguins were in Antarctica only. In Antarctica, penguins had plenty of feathers, enough to die when they progressed to the tropics. However, penguins also had variation in their feathers, so when a current brought them to the Galapagos, they quickly started to evolve. The few nucleotides that controlled feather thickness made a large difference to the survival of the penguins. In this case, they were important enough to make a difference easily. The DNA was inherited as a single unit, but some single units had single parts that made a difference.

I can do that -- for instance, when I play with my kids, I'm real good at playing the role of ""Ken"" when we imagine that ""Barbie goes to the beach"" Surely the fossil record shows gradualism or not.  I bought a book a while back at a half-price bookstore from Niles Eldredge called The Myths of Evolution. He says the following about gradualism:   ----------------------------------------  Change in this manner (gradualism) is just not found in the fossil record. pg. 48  Darwin invented the myth that species were not real to convince the world of the nonmyth that evolution had occured. pg. 52  Darwin's prediction that long-term evolutionary change should produce a systematic pattern of gradual, progressive change in the fossil record was faulty. pg. 53  As we have seen in the previous chapter, the usual conception casts evolution as a gradual, steady process of adaptive change. And we have already seen that the fossil record conflicts with that view. pg. 57  We're faced more with a great leap of faith -- that gradual, progressive, adaptive change underlies the general pattern of evolutionary change we see in the rocks -- than any hard evidence. pg. 57  ------------------------------------  I guess I would consider myself more of a PE guy than a gradualist simply because of what the fossils indicate. It seems to me that instead of evolving gradually that animals evolve quickly -- like the spiders on my shed. (do you find it odd that they emerged yellow in the spring?)   It seems butterflies have this same ability.....Evolution sure is amazing!  For instance, Monteiro said, the darker wing patterns that show up in butterflies that emerge in the spring serve to warm up the butterfly faster, whereas butterflies that emerge in the summer have lighter colors.  ""Also, many butterflies that emerge in the wet season in the tropics have large, conspicuous marks on their wings that deflect the attacks of predators while the butterflies are actively finding mates and laying eggs, while the dry-season cohorts are very cryptic, trying to blend in with their environment and not attract any attention from predators until the rains arrive again,"" she said  http://unisci.com/stories/20021/0313021.htm  Where can I find an explanation about this phenomenon?

fact_3448	fact	"Chapter 7.-Whether Even the Remotest Islands Received Their Fauna from the Animals Which Were Preserved, Through the Deluge, in the Ark.  There is a question raised about all those kinds of beasts which are not domesticated, nor are produced like frogs from the earth, but are propagated by male and female parents, such as wolves and animals of that kind; and it is asked how they could be found in the islands after the deluge, in which all the animals not in the ark perished, unless the breed was restored from those which were preserved in pairs in the ark. It might, indeed, be said that they crossed to the islands by swimming, but this could only be true of those very near the mainland; whereas there are some so distant, that we fancy no animal could swim to them. But if men caught them and took them across with themselves, and thus propagated these breeds in their new abodes, this would not imply an incredible fondness for the chase. At the same time, it cannot be denied that by the intervention of angels they might be transferred by God's order or permission. If, however, they were produced out of the earth as at their first creation, when God said, ""Let the earth bring forth the living creature,""25 this makes it more evident that all kinds of animals were preserved in the ark, not so much for the sake of renewing the stock, as of prefiguring the various nations which were to be saved in the church; this, I say, is more evident, if the earth brought forth many animals in islands to which they could not cross over.  St. Aurelius Augustin  http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/NPNF1-0...#P2783_1557226  Further...from a Q&A Orthodox site  Q  A non-Christian person has pointed out what he believes to be a contradiction in the book of Genesis. First, God commanded Noah to take two of every living creature without distinguishing between clean or not clean ones: Gen 6: 19-20 ""And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female. Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive."" Then, God distinguished between the clean creatures and the unclean as follow: Gen 7: 2-3 ""Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the male and his female: and of beasts that are not clean by two, the male and his female. Of fowls also of the air by sevens, the male and the female; to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth."" Noah though, took only two of every kind ignoring the second command of God by taking seven of the clean ones as it is stated here: Gen 7: 8-9 ""Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of fowls, and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth, There went in two and two unto Noah into the ark, the male and the female, as God had commanded Noah.""  A  Noah did not ignore God's commandment but followed it exactly. God's command to Noah was ""Two of every sort ?. , to keep them alive"" (Gen 6:19-20) Those are the minimum of each species to go in the ark and be kept alive afterwards. Then God gave Noah more specific instructions, to take seven pairs of the clean beasts and of the clean birds. The purpose of this became clear after the flood. The birds were needed to explore the earth (Gen 8:7-12) and the clean animals to be used as sacrifice to the Lord. Noah did not ignore this commandment but the Bible says "" There went in two and two unto Noah into the ark, the male and the female""  If you read this carefully it does not say one pair of each species but that they went in as pairs males and females. If Noah had taken only one pair of each and then offered each of these pairs in sacrifice, these species would have become completely extinct."

fact_3249	fact	"Plenty of problems with that ""study"" and parts of it are just hilarious.  Number one, socialization plays a huge role in an individual's reaction to handling weapons. A teen who was raised in a family of outdoorsmen and exposed to firearms in a responsible, constructive fashion would react much differently than a teen who's only exposure to firearms is his way-cool arsenal in Call of Duty.  I think that much the same results could be obtained with exchanging the ""gun"" with a football. Putting a dozen or so 18-22 y.o. in a room with nothing but a football would ensure that an athletic pecking order would be established very quickly. Domineering males would be throwing the football around in a competitive, even punishing fashion, submissive males would be cowering, hoping nobody throws the ball to them. Elevated testosterone levels would be expected in both; some from competition and some from fight / flight. . .  Both groups would exhibit the ""aggressive"" behavior the study offers for diametrically opposite reasons. This effect is compounded because of the anonymity; the domineering would want to prove manhood and superiority and the submissives would want to inflict revenge, . . . especially if it is on an unsuspecting non-participant. I would go so far as to hypothesize that the submissives would put more hot sauce in the water than the ""aggressive"" domineering subjects.  I actually laughed out loud when the overly concerned testers believed they needed to defuse the potentially deadly aggression they caused in the test subjects:  ""Because of the potentially arousing nature of the experiment, we wanted to ensure that all subjects were reasonably calm when they left the lab. Therefore, all subjects next watched a relaxing video of nature scenes and classical musical. Given that subjects had been deceived, we next debriefed them, emphasizing that they should not feel badly about any aggressive behavior they exhibited.""

fact_3248	fact	"In some cases yes, in others no. If the mutation gives a huge advantage, then there will be a decline in the size of the gene pool for a while (eg when the Australian rabbit population was reduced form 500 million to 100 million by myxomatosis, the gene pool strunk as a result and the genetic ""mutation"" that gave increased resistance spread throughout the whole population as a result).

fact_3328	fact	It is entirely possible for a man armed with one hand grenade, and yes, hand grenades can be bought, to not only take out a tank, but kill everyone inside. All one would have to do is catch a tank on patrol, while it is at idle speed, jump up on the tank and toss the grenade down the tanks barrell. The explosion from the grenade would cause the shell in the tanks barrell to also explode, and then the rest of the ammo in the tank, and wallah, dead crew and no more opperable tank. As far as a plane is concerned, almost all of todays planes are controlled by computers, at least the guidance and weapons systems, so I would try to bring a plane down with a simple computer. You tell one planes weapons to target another plane, and boom, one less plane. Or one might dig a trench with which to trap a tank, and after a tank falls into the trench and gets stuck, you kill the exiting soldiers, pull the tank out, and now you have your very own tank. Of course, none of this is full proof, but it is highly possible.

fact_3464	fact	"Yes. A proper understanding of rights is neccessary to know when you are aggressing against another person. Most children learn about rights intuitively through social interaction, a child take's another child's toy ""That's mine"", they say, they may fight over it, but they learn that when people lay contrary claims to things, violent conflict is the result.  It is useful to refine this intuitive belief system into something consistent, both individually, and in shaping the law of a society. A society in which people work together through trade and friendship will always be more prosperous and safe than one in which rights are systematically ignored and violent conflict is the norm.  It is not useful to talk about rights with people who treat them as subjective, based on value judgements, ie ""People have a right to life, because life is more valuable than being able to have an abortion"", or ""People have a right to have an abortion, because being able to have an abortion is more important than a fetus"". There is nothing to debate, we may as well go over whether strawberry or chocolate is a better flavour for a milkshake. In a free society we can disagree over what is ""more important"" and make our own choices, but if value judgements are used to determine law, the only possible outcome is the oppression of those with minority values.  No argument can be made about value judgements, they do not convince anyone, they do not provide just solutions. Politically, to demand your values be enforced (by virtue of your political power) is to demand the rule of force rather than justice.  There are only two choices: The rule of law, justice, a free society, built on the moral foundation of individual rights - or the rule of the majority, built on the arbitrary value judgements and preferences of those weilding power."

fact_3128	fact	Actually, no. A specific fossil cannot be, and probably will never be, identified as the ancestor of birds with any certainty. It is doubtful that the fossil record will ever be so complete as to make that possible. Your remark tends to support the confusion of creationists. They tend to represent the idea of a transitional as ancestral. Since the ancestral status of any particular fossil can't be acertained for any given fossil, and since any given fossil is usually placed in one of the major taxonomic groups, creationists feel justified in claiming that it is just a bird - thus, no transitionals exist.  But if you look at life you will see that it is like a bush with many branches. What is being discovered in China is part of the bush that was the lineage from theropod to avian, as was Archaeopteryx. That bush is what is expected from evolutionary theory. There are several fossils that show a progression from dinosaur to bird. We don't expect a ladder-like chain of a single lineage that evolved until a point that it branched into the birds. There are many lines along that path that went no where but were similar to the one that became the birds.

That Hi_Its_Me went along with the mistake showed that he was no longer discussing evolution or even science, but arguing atheism vs theism.  The reason we do this is because science and evolution are not atheism and scientific theories have boundaries. No scientific theory gives a worldview or an explanation of everything. Even the anticipated ""theory of everything"" combining Relativity and QM won't explain everything. Evolution has the boundary of the first life. It assumes that a universe and living organisms exist. Just like Cell Theory assumes the same things. If you want to discuss the origin of the first life, then you have to talk about the various theories within the field of abiogenesis. If you want to talk about the origin of the universe, then you need to discuss the various theories within the field of cosmology."
fact_3288	fact	"**  The word subordinate, it will surprise you to learn, is not limited in its application to human social groups. You should check your semantics before you bleat on about words you only partially comprehend. Of course that's never slowed you down in any other context, so keep on bleating and braying. Your problem, not mine. But just for FYI--  ""subordinate  adjective  Below another in standing or importance: inferior, junior, lesser, low, lower2, minor, minor-league, petty, secondary, small, subaltern, under. Informal smalltime. See over/under.  In a position of subordination: collateral, dependent, subject, subservient. See over/under, part/whole.""  The usage as a value judgement applies here because it rflects the darwinist/materialist attitude towards genes and whole organisms, where genes are given primary importance, especially in evolutionary biology.  The second sense, that of 'contingent' and 'dependent' is strictly a matter of objective classification and is often used in systems studies, and is not confined to human social systems at all. For instance, our moon and sun are subordinate to our sun. See--  ""dependent also dependant  adjective  Determined or to be determined by someone or something else: conditional, conditioned, contingent, relative, reliant, subject. See start/end.  In a position of subordination: collateral, subject, subordinate, subservient. See over/under, part/whole.""

fact_3263	fact	But there is evidence that we do evolve. I'll give you an example. In areas of west Africa where malaria is endemic there is an allele of hemoglobin that confers resistance when heterozygous. In other environments that allele is not beneficial and is, in fact, deleterious. It is fatal when homozygous. Now according to evolutionary theory such an allele should decline where it offers no benefit. Studies show that this allele is less frequent by about 2 percentage points in Americans of west African ancestry.

As written, ""Godlessness; immorality"", implies that immorality is synonymous with godlessness but the thesaurus entry for godlessness does not list immorality as a synonym.

The second refutation sounds like something Rousseau said, along the lines of ""I don't care about logic. I'll believe in God privately."" If one can claim that the power of God is beyond logic, but still true, then one can also claim that the powerlessness of God is beyond logic, but true. Similarily, I can claim that ""2+2=5"" is true by saying ""We humans are too simple-minded to understand it, therefore it must be true."" That's fallacious."

Rip, Jaap; Nierman, Melchior C.; Ross, Colin J.; Jukema, Jan Wouter; Hayden, Michael R.; Kastelein, John J.P.; Stroes, Erik S.G.; Kuivenhoven, Jan Albert  Abstract:  mdash;: Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) hydrolyzes triglycerides in the circulation and promotes the hepatic uptake of remnant lipoproteins. Since the gene was cloned in 1989, more than 100 LPL gene mutations have been identified, the majority of which cause loss of enzymatic function. In contrast to this, the naturally occurring LPLS447X variant is associated with increased lipolytic function and an anti-atherogenic lipid profile and can therefore be regarded as a gain-of-function mutation. This notion combined with the facts that 20% of the general population carries this prematurely truncated LPL and that it may protect against cardiovascular disease has led to extensive clinical and basic research into this frequent LPL mutant. It is only until recently that we begin to understand the molecular mechanisms that underlie the beneficial effects associated with LPLS447X. This review summarizes the current literature on this interesting LPL variant.  This one provides rather good protection from hardening of the arteries.

fact_3372	fact	"I think that if Montalban is anything, he is opportunistic. Someone (Ungerdunn I think) pointed out to him that the phrase, ""survival of the fittest"" reduces to a tautology. As seems to be his bent, Montalban generalized that fact to claim that somehow evolution is a tautology. As I mentioned in a previous post, without further criterion, ""survival of the fittest"" is a tautology. But Darwin did offer further criterion in chapter after chapter years before he acquiesced to use the phrase. Certainly Montalban has read ""Origin"" since he quotes it. How is it that he missed chapter 2? How is it that he failed to understand Darwin's meaning in chapter 1?  But I will concede that ""Origin"" is not an easy read. Understanding requires a command of English beyond the ordinary, as well as an understanding of biological science at a graduate level. Darwin was not addressing a popular audience, even though his book became popular. Darwin was addressing the naturalist of his day - what came to be called biologists in our day. English grammar and usage has evolved since Darwin's day and biology has advanced. When one considers the importance to evolutionary theory of what Darwin said (even without the misunderstandings of the uneducated), it is a matter of historical significance only. Darwin's theories have been supported or falsified many times over. For the most part, his theories have been supported. He was wrong on some minor points. Essentially, a quote from Darwin without reference to some meaningful publication since is quite meaningless."

It's still the atomic theory so atoms aren't the absolute truth and since chemistry stems from the atomic theory (chemicals and elements are, according to the theory, made up of atoms) chemistry isn't the absolute truth. gravity can't be the absolute truth because it's still the theory of gravity.

fact_3366	fact	"Ditto! With that in mind...  I want to let you make your own arguments for your position before I post a rebuttal to any of them, for reasons described above. Instead, though, I can post a brief few arguments of my own.  Firstly: the statement you are trying to support is ""Biologically speaking, a human individual's life begins at conception"". However, the word 'life' - that which you are arguing has a factually determinable beginning, does not have an absolute biological definition. To quote the wikipedia article on it: ""It is still a challenge for scientists and philosophers to define life in unequivocal terms"". This is doubly the case when considering the 'life' of an individual, as opposed to the 'life' of, say, a skin cell. For example, a person with no brain activity can be composed of living cells if they are kept on life support, but legally and medically the individual is considered dead.  The argument, then: If 'life' has no definitive definition, how can you argue that it has a clearly definable start?  Secondly: Consider a zygote. According to you, it is an individual. But a zygote can split into two - to form monozygotic, or 'identical', twins. Before splitting, it is one 'individual'. Afterwards, it is two. Where has the extra individual come from? Given that the split can happen up to 15 days after fertilisation, when was the start of that individuals life?  Thirdly: In contrast to identical twins, consider a chimera organism. A chimera is made up of cells containing one of two different strands of human DNA - they are formed when two fertilised eggs or early embryos collide and become one embryo, which then goes on to be a single human being. Given that the single individual was created by the merging of two different individuals (by your definition), when was the biological start of their life?"

fact_3410	fact	There's a distinct difference... so what? No baby at any age can live outside the womb. It still needs care and attention like any other. This difference in age doesn't mean anything.
fact_3376	fact	Actually it isn't. No, really, it isn't; I'm not making this up; I think you've genuinely crossed a wire somewhere there.  Traits are partially described by genes; they're the starting point - as you once put it, the 'hard drive' - but the process of turning genes into an organism is unquestionably influenced by the environment - chemically, thermally etc etc. That's one reason frogs need so damn many genes while placental animals can get away with a lot fewer: frogspawn have to tolerate such widely varying temperatures during development and need proteins that work correctly at all those temperatures, whereas mammalian foetuses develop in a chemically and thermally regulated environment.  Weismann's barrier says only that hereditary information moves from genes to body cells but never in reverse. The genes provide the starting point, the developmental process - modulated by environmental factors - turns that information into an organism, but there's no feedback. Retroviruses might constitute a hole in that barrier, which opens up some interesting possibilities.  Anyway, the point is, the ToE as it stands does not say, in any shape or form, that genes alone dictate traits and nothing else gets a look in. What it does say is that although the environment can modulate the eventual phenotype during development, it can't directly feed back the results of expressing those genes to the genotype. The environment can only have an indirect 'say' in the genotype of organisms, by allowing some to flourish and inhibiting the success of others.  That's why, in the other thread where we're discussing the butterflies, I describe the Darwinian process of arriving at environmental sensitivity in the way I do: the environment modulates the phenotype differently in the different seasons (based on chemical or thermal variation) and Natural Selection, in this case, is the organisms with genes that consistently yield the 'best' phenotypes in that variable environment flourishing better. Simmer for a couple of million years and... well, there you go.
fact_3438	fact	Well considering heredity does not lie reside in our genes, but in the way our genome reacts with the environment, (including induced thoughts, beliefs, feelings, sensations, cultural traditions, internal and external contexts, etc) then it pretty much is when it comes to heredity.

fact_3148	fact	But they didn't have sexual relations. This was from a sperm bank- there was nothing that made the two people create one being.   Nonetheless, this is a side issue for future debates. My main point is homosexuality is a disorder that the government shouldn't be condoning. The government obviously doesn't condone pedophilia, poligamy, and incest. Why is the government condoning homosexuality?

fact_3202	fact	Actually even with a concealed weapons permit, I do not believe you are allowed to possess a firearm on board an aircraft.  The Second Amendment protects the right to OWN firearms and other weapons, and to use them in self defense. It does not grant a person the right to bring a gun on a plane, nor do I see how it could be interpreted to mean such a thing. Where do you get this question?  And terrorists already recieve their weapons illegally. It is NOT LEGAL for any country to sell weapons to a terrorist country/nation/organization. But somehow they always get their hands on weapons. Hmm... I don't think they go out to their local shooting range and pick up a 9mm pistol. While it is possible (if they passed the backgroud check that is), its not probable. Because they would still have the illegal avenue to pursue the purchase of firearms with. If you want to ban firearms, the only thing you're doing is taking away the rights of citizens to defend themselves. Terrorists and criminals in general will find a way to obtain the firearms they desire no matter what laws are in effect. Llike they would follow the laws anyways? They ARE terrorists you know.)
fact_3203	fact	Same evidence, different interpretations based on different starting faiths.  We will use the Lucy type skeleton and the next supposed evolutionary progression Homo Hablis (for short hand, HH). CAT scans of the inner ear of HH showed that the semi-circular cannals, which determine balance and locomotion, are more like those of baboons than those of humans. This is not what one would expect if the evolutionary story about human origins is true, HH should be more bipedal than the Lucy type skeleton from which it supposedly evolved from, but it is not. In fact, most scientists now think that HH is not one creature, but instead is several types of creatures that do not belong together, at least three or more different animals, hence making it an invalid category. Further more, it cannot be our ancestor as no such animal ever existed.  Hence, the evidence is interpreted more sensibly and reasonable through a creationary model. This is just an example of what they may do with some fossils, IMVHO.
fact_3217	fact	Hillarious. I remember seeing that a while back. That's liberals for you, the laws they propose are for the 'peasants', not for them to obey. They, afterall, are better suited for making decisions like these than you. You need them to think for you.. to care for you.. cradle to grave.  You may also recall that famed anti-gunner Rosie O'Donnell has armed bodyguards but says you shouldn't have guns yourself. You cannot be trusted, afterall. And who was that writer who shot the kid in the hand that was swimming in his pool late one night? Carl something. Another anti-gunner who preaches 'do as I say, not as I do'.  Liberals.. LOL!
fact_3149	fact	"Hold up, your changing your argument. You said ""I have never been accosted by an armed assailant. Hence, I see no reason I need to carry a concealed handgun in order to be brave enough to move about my hometown."". This is the reason you gave for not carrying a firearm, I was simply countering that argument because it didn't sound very logical to me, still doesn't.  As to your new statment, I'll need more info. What do your consider an ""accidental discharge"" of a firearm. I ask because I do not consider someone pulling the trigger to be ""accidental"" and therefore I consider true accidental discharges to be pretty uncommon.  Yes, for most people I think the chances of being in a car accident are greater then the chances of needing a gun for self defense. But, I'm not sure why that would make a difference. If it was reversed I would still where my seatbelt.  God Bless"

fact_3388	fact	"Perhaps, but as studies have noted, contributing the growing of livestock is one of top things one can do to harm the environment.  ""The livestock sector is a major player [in climate change], responsible for 18% of greenhouse gas emissions measured in CO2 equivalent. This is a higher share than transport.""  I've read that methane and nitrous oxide have greater warming potential than Co2.  Furthermore, IF the government were to become involved and create an objective to reduce meat consumption in a country I'm sure the people would be aware as to why and make their choices. Living green is already a popular topic so many people who are not already aware of efficient energy use would eventually learn if this issue came to a front."
fact_3439	fact	**  Not true. I most certainly do apply EAM to all empirical observations of biological originality, just to see if it still applies. To date, it always has. As for darwinian interpretations of that same evidence, presenting them and defending them is your responsibility, not mine.
fact_3411	fact	Just out of curiosity, what do you feel you could sue the company for? Descrimination? Could I sue Wal Mart or Dillons for not carrying a line of adult movies and sex toys? After all, I have a right to own adult movies and sex toys. Doesn't that mean that Wal Mart automatically has the responsibillity to provide those goods? After all, they are the biggest retailer in my area.

fact_3375	fact	Of course. The Kellerman study points out that a firearm is 43 times more likely to be used on its owner than in self defense.  This is why it makes perfect sense to hand all our guns over to criminals. We can then take them away using Kung Fu and use them against their owners. (According to Kellerman, we are guaranteed to be 43 times more successful that way.)
fact_3413	fact	And how many guns found at crime scenes have been linked back to their original owners?

fact_3361	fact	Not if you have permission to do one from the buyer. If I sold a firearm, and didn't know the person so well, I would do one. I have contacts in businesses who can do them for me for free. Its just a smart thing to do. Should it be the law? No way. But I would do it. Better safe than sorry in this instance.

fact_3188	fact	No you face it. Science has managed to show that life and non-life are not distinct and are indeed simply a continuium of molecular complexity and function. There is no clear difference which can separate life from molecules which are generally NOT considered to be living. There is only matter and energy found in configurations of widely differing complexity thats it so far as matter/energy at the basic temperature range we exist in. Nobody is stumped by this at all. Indeed one might well declare that life is dead - except it sounds strange.

fact_3215	fact	Thus, an important point is raised:
fact_3229	fact	I suspect that you are thinking of birds. But early birds had fingered claws on those wings. It is generally true that no organ ever springs into existance completely developed where nothing existed before. The wings of bats, birds, and pterodactyls are merely the modified fore-limb of a tetrapod. There is evidence that insect wings may have arisen from some sort of thermal panel. And of course, size has considerable relevance to flight. Wingless spiders fly by spinning a loop of silk that is carried by the moving air. Very small insects require almost no wings to fly. What they do is more similar to a whale in water than a bird in air. If by chance, a small animal is upsized because of a competetive advantage, and the wings are too, then it becomes a larger flying animal.

Yet you have yet to post evidence of me saying that to anyone. Nor have you supported your original claim here, you said this: Last I checked, no credible fossil fuel firm hired YEC geologists. Prove this assertion since you researched it thoroughly enough to start a thread about.
fact_3189	fact	That isn't the arguement your buddy made. He claimed guns could be controlled by dogs and snakes and stuff like that.  Do you have any examples of dogs or snakes controlling drugs and going on rampages and blowing folks heads off? Even claimed the dog was mournful for his bereaved master.

fact_3360	fact	Of course not. No evolutionary biologist ever claimed that it was. Evolution is a change in the alle frequency in a population over time - like in the case of the peppered moths. Over about 150 years the dark allele increased to almost the entire population and then it decreased again. That is evolution. It is quite apparent that natural selection was the probably cause. You see, no one has proposed another explanation that has stood up to examination. Majerus is trying to verify that the evolution really was the result of predation by birds. It seems a reasonable hypothesis but Majerus had several quibbles with Kettlewell's methodology even though he believes the hypothesis to be correct.
