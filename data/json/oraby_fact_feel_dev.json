Is it absolutely impossible for you to debate issues while actually responding to what we really say rather than reading into what we say and redefining it to fit your warped and perverse perspective? emoticonXBanghead emoticonXDonno   I mean, how sick and disturbed must your powers of reason and logic be for you to interpret my argument that Man, because of our linear view of time, is misreading the fact that God placed the stars in space at the same time much more recently than it appears to us to have occurred, that God is then an epic liar? Is God responsible for how we interpret the evidence when we attempt to do it apart from placing Him first and foremost into the equation? Is He the liar? Or are you who think like that deceiving yourselves by ignoring His place in the creation of time and space?   It is just completely beyond you to think from an honest and objective perspective, isn't it obvious child!   But for a more practical answer, imagine this. In the beginning, space was a void which spanned all of eternity. Only one object/energy source encompassed all of it from one end of its massive emptiness to the other, and that person was my God Yahweh. And in one second or minutes time, he spoke all of the stars that have ever existed, at different intensities and strengths, which causes them to burn out at different times. But he placed them at the very inner and outer limits of time and space at that time. Liken it to a farmer with a hand full of seeds. He pulls back his arm and throws those seeds to the end of the plot of land he is sowing at that time. To the ants on the ground, if they measured the time it would take to reach the farthest seed, it would represent a great distance, but to the farmer it was just one arms throw in time to disperse hundreds of seeds at one time.   Now here we are as finite creatures who can only see time from our linear perspective. Time is plastic. Our linear measure is man made for our convenience only. That you place what we call the measure of so called light years is arbitrary at best. But I am getting too deep for you and this discussion. The point is that our God has the ability to place the stars in every corner of not only what we again, arbitrarily call our universe, but throughout all of time and space.   But to we puny finite humans who have invented telescopes, it appears that these stars we are seeing today are ancient based on the perceived yet arbitrarily arrived at distance you believe they are from us. But since you are unable to even grasp the hugeness of our God, you also fail to appreciate that light years are a measure of distance rather than time. So by that definition alone, it is foolish to equate it with Earth time rather than Gods ability to reach any distant place in time and space and place stars there. emoticonXGood", "label": "feel"}

I can agree somewhat with the idea of hesitating to interfere when an altercation seems imminent, but I cannot agree that armed citizens should never \"endanger the lives of others\" by pulling his piece and firing at the perp.

Why is it ok for your side to determine what is right for society but when I offer my vote/opinion, I am imposing something evil on you?   And why do you people constantly assert how tolerant you are and how intolerant we are when you have absolutely no tolerance for our position regarding the immoral and perverse lifestyle you defend? Where is my right to disagree with you secular humanists whose immorality has led us down the slippery slope of social chaos our society finds itself in today? Here's one example of what I mean.  What is a \"rainbow party\"?  I overheard my daughter saying she is going to attend another one. Is this something I should be concerned about?  Best Answer - Chosen by Asker  The girls wear different colored lipstick and take turns performing oral sex on the boys -- leaving a rainbow of colors on the the boys' private parts.  Watch the movie \"Thirteen\" (Thirteen (2003) ) and get more involved in the life of your daughter (and other kids if you have any)! There is no pleading ignorance on this one... this information is readily out there, and has been for a few years.   Children only learn what they are taught, so it is up to us, the parents, to be actively involved in their lives AND to be aware of what's in the popular culture that they are learning from their peers and the media.  What is a \"rainbow party\"? - Yahoo! Answers  This is the result of your secular humanist pop culture which has completely secularized our society and has attempted to erase God and any recognition of his values from our society over the past 50 years. But what is most sad is that you will respond with the opinion that we don't even have a problem at all. You are completely void of the ability to recognize that we have lost our way morally speaking as a people, and are running to destruction with our fingers in our ears as a civilization.   We traditionalists understand very well that we either rise or fall together as a people which is why we still oppose what you represent. But we don't do it to oppress you at all, we do it to preserve our Nation because God will surely lift His hand from protecting us as we abandon Him and His values which you humanists have worked so hard to erase. But alas, I waste my time even attempting to reason with a spiritually dead secular humanist who has nothing more to respond with but excuses and shallow justifications for your world view! emoticonXRolleyes", "label": "feel"}

{"text": "I see patterns here. My girlfriend and I have been debating this subject a lot lately. When we first started debating, she did so in \"solid support of creationism\" (yes Frog I did not write those words by accident). She said, and I quote, \"Evolution is bullsh*t\". Last night, after two or three evenings of this stuff back and forth (after I resoundingly bested her on every point, basically) she affirmed that she does believe in evolution and has \"kind of\" always believed in evolution, but that she has many reservations and questions about it.  The pattern? \"Solid support of creationism turns into an admission that evolution is the truth, but with reservations.\" I find that pattern a little bit amusing.  Last night, she had abandoned most of her philosophical objections because I made the concession that everyone has to make if they want to make any headway whatsoever with a budding evolutionist who can't let go of their religious objections: \"Okay, maybe it had God's stamp of approval.\" When you say that, you can move on to a real conversation. In this case, she bombarded me with a million questions that I couldn't answer. She seemed excited about it, not debating, but asking me about the wonders of biology with a long series of \"...but what about this\" and \"...what about that\" type of questions. One thing she keyed on was evolution as it applies to a larger ecosystem. I couldn't quite grasp what she was asking because I don't think she herself was very clear on the question, but to make a long story short, I got the distinct impression that she simply can't wholeheartedly accept evolution because she can't begin to fathom the complexity of the science behind it. I have told her time and time again: \"Just because you don't understand something, that doesn't make it wrong.\" I see this same pattern here in your words, Frog. You're talking about wild collisions of atoms and saying that the foundations who donate hundreds of millions of dollars a year to research know less than you do, because they're wasting their money. You're making this subject so much bigger and more philosophical than it has to be, Frog. Is evolution by far the best answer we have to the question of the diversity of species?

Largely because it accuratly describes and accounts for certain important underlying structures of our contemporary world. It is also flecxible enough to apply to more than just issues concerning economic classes.  I find marxist approach to economics interesting from a historic point of view, but not that useful. Basicly that is because many of the assumptions and predictions marxism made has since been falsefied and I have yet to see any rendition of the theories of old into anything useful.  I find Communism, as a state-less utopia based on solidarity and community, void of property ownership and class conflict a beutiful idea. But I don`t think it can be achieved through pursuing the socialistic state of pure governmental ownership of the means of production. In fact, I`m quite sceptic that it ever can be achieved (regardless of how you pursue it)  I find the stalinist and maoist attempts to interpret marxism and apply it to the real world one of the largest attrocities commited throughout modern history. Not only to the hundreds of thousands in the Gulabs and chinese prisons or the millions of victims of starvation or political violence, but also to all of those who actually believed in the proletarian revulotion and where sourly dissapointed when they found themselves slavering in the iron-mines i Kaukasus or working in the rice-fields with a gun-barrel as the only motivation for working harder.  I find Socialism, as a practice of democratic ownership of means of production and re-distribution of resources from the more productive or wealthy to the less productive and poor as a good tool to build a succesful society. But as with any tool, it shouldn`t be used in every situation, but only when and where appropriate. When using the tool of socialism, you are most often distorting the effects of the other tools of market forces. This needs to be considered as the market forces have one important attribute, efficiency.   There`s a summarise of my oppinions and reasons for having them.

Allow me to mention something right here, and point out I'm a Methodist....ahem THE BIBLE WAS WRITTEN BY MEN. Arguing that the events in the bible happened or not is a different issue, but God did not give us a master copy of the bible and tell us to copy it. Biblical scholars have noted that the bible is an amalgam of different authors who had different outlooks on God. The bible is an excellent source of faith and guidance, it is not an infallible work and does not answer all questions.  As to your second point, argueing that liberals wish to analyze porn and worship death just shows you haven't really put much thought into this contention. You are right that the government has removed references to Christianity in its subsidiaries like public school. There is a good reason for this. I can't for the life of me recall where this quote is from but it said:  \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.\"   This means government isn't suppose to support religious groups.

{"text": "So? Isn't that exactly what we would want: people who conduct legal business instead of illegal business? That means less crime, even if organized crime is still into other things. Making a drug illicit effectively creates another market for organized crime.  Look at alcohol and prohibition. Alcohol was a huge market for organized crime back in prohibition days. How many mobsters or gangs still have distilleries? They only people who operate illegal distilleries nowadays are indepedant brewers in rural areas. When you can get a wide variety of quality-controlled drugs at a licensed store down the road, no one wants to pay prohibition prices to get goods of uncertain purity or quality. Organized crime goes elsewhere to seek massive profits.  I think marijuana is an easy case, its blatantly obvious that most of the harm done by pot on our society comes from associated crime: drug deals gone bad or turf wars, money put into organized crime's hands, otherwise law-abiding citizens put in jail or given criminal records. More dangerous and addictive drugs are a harder sell, I think.  Drug education is broken. Often, drug education is distorted to over-emphasize the dangers of drugs, which mystifies the drug, often increases their allure and destroys confidence in the source of information because the information is obviously biased and incomplete. With or without legalization, I believe the best solution to drug abuse is preventative: quality information and education. Reduction of poverty would do a lot to curb drug abuse (and drug-related crime) as well.  Also, marijuana use in the Netherlands actually went down after legalization, as did alcohol consumption post-prohibition in the US back in the 30's.

{"text": "Well, I am a creationist, and I would hope I can think logically (it's generally a good quality for an accountant and tax attorney to have). The difference between microevolution and evolution as an explanation for the beginning of a species is simple. In microevolution a species is simply adapting to it's environments. In evolution as is usually meant by the word you are talking about the formation of an entirely new creature from inorganic compounds. If this is possible I pose a few questions for you.  1) Why have no new creatures evolved from inorganic compounds in human memory?  2) How did these inorganic compounds decide that some creatures should evolve, while others of the same species did not? Why are there not some apes that have evolved into humans by now? Why didn't all apes evolve into humans?  3) One of my favorite pieces of confusion from evolutionists involve fossils. How do you know how old a fossil is? Every evolutionist I have asked has stated that fossils are dated by the rock layer they are found in, but if you then ask them how the rock layer is dated they answer that it is dated by the fossils that where discovered in it! That's a classical example of circular reasoning.  I am not a scientist, so I cannot present all the evidence against evolution as clearly as someone with a scientific education and background might do. If you are truly interested in learning more about the creationist arguments against evolution you can check out the article located at http://www.answersingenesis.org/docs2004/1106ng.asp.

Should I start claiming that your standard is getting ever more complicated when it comes to valuing human life?  The abortion debate is a debate about a specific set of circumstances. In those circumstances, I claim that the fetus gets rights to life (outbalancing the mother's rights to her own body) after it can gain mental existence (around the third trimester) and you claim that it gains rights from conception on. Outside of that specific set of circumstances then we encounter other considerations and, yes, things get more complicated.  In the abortion debate there are only two living beings to consider - the mother and the fetus and their relative rights and value. If you step outside of the abortion debate, then many other things start coming into play, complicating not only the moral picture which I present but the moral picture which you present as well.

{"text": "Actually the Bible/creation makes quite a lot predictions that science has recently verified. Some examples include: that the Earth is round (Isa. 40:22); the Earth is suspended in space without support (Job 26:7); sea currents; the hydrologic cycle; the first and second laws of thermodynamics (e.g. Isa 51:6); and the fact that Orion cluster is seperating and that the Pleadies cluster is staying together as a group (Job 38:31); and many others. Since there was a global flood according to the Bible, we would expect there to be many fossils rapidly despoited and this is what we see in some parts of the fossil record. For example, there are some fossil beds are found in sedimentary rock, deposited by water so rapidly as to bury some creatures while still giving birth and eating food. Creationists have also made predictions such as the fact that there can be variation with in a kind, but one kind cannot change into other kinds. This is what we observe now in the present, and is backed up by the fossil record. We would expect that many rocks, such as Uluru in Australia, would not be \"ordered in layers\". Once again, this is what we observe. Creationists predicted that mutations and natural selection are down hill processes, i.e. information losing. We would also expect everything to be running down, we might also expect to know that some dinosaurs survived the flood but most likely died in the ice age that followed the flood. Several cultural groups have given very descriptive information about dinosaur like creatures. Remember, they would not have had a picture book with dinosaurs in it, the Aboriginal's for example, had paintings of dinosaur like creatures in caves; the amazing amount of design and complexity in the universe; Laws of Nature. Also many other predictions.   So as you can see, creationists have made many predictions (as has the Bible) and all are 100% scientificly correct. IF, if such fossils are found and they are obviously transitional, then that would certainly aid the evolutionist case. But evolution is supposed to have millions of transitional fossils, they have a hand full of highly debatable ones.  Btw, I am not trying to impress you by any means of your imagination.

From what I have read of the new (and much criticized by the media elite) Florida self defense bill, it sounds like Florida is just returning to the old common law standard for justifiable self-defense, where retreat to the wall is not required when faced with a threat of deadly force. The first I heard of the new law change in Fla. was from the misfortune of watching a CBS nightly news story on it. The reporter said with disbelief in his voice (the kind of \u00e2\u0080\u009cmy God what are they doing!\u00e2\u0080\u009d panic you hear when someone passes a law they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like) that the new law states that if you shoot someone you are actually presumed innocent of any crime. My only comment on this is that the reporter obviously knows nothing of our legal system. Whenever any person is prosecuted for any crime, whether in Fla. or anywhere else in America, that person is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. I thought about e-mailing our standard jury instruction to the CBS guy:  THE COURT INSTRUCTS THE JURY THAT the defendant is presumed innocent. You should not assume the defendant is guilty because he has been indicted and is on trial. This presumption of innocence remains with the defendant throughout the trial and is enough to require you to find the defendant not guilty unless and until the Commonwealth proves each and every element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. This does not require proof beyond all possible doubt, nor is the Commonwealth required to disprove every conceivable circumstance of innocence. However, suspicion or probability of guilt is not enough for a conviction.  There is no burden on the defendant to produce any evidence.  A reasonable doubt is a doubt based on your sound judgment after a full and impartial consideration of all the evidence in the case.  In any event, I have heard the re-tread of the same old arguments again about Fla. becoming the \u00e2\u0080\u009cwild, wild west,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009ctraffic accidents becoming shootouts,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and Fla. becoming the \u00e2\u0080\u009cgunshine state.\u00e2\u0080\u009d These are the same arguments which were made when Fla. adopted a concealed carry law.

The mass of the fission products is less than that of the original fuel. Matter has been \"destroyed.\" But ov course, it became a form of energy - eventually electricity. On the other side, virtual particles spring into existance all the time in a vacuum. But the are a particle and an anti-particle and the net energy is zero so energy is conserved. These ideas come from quantum mechanics. A virtual particle is a particle that can never be directly detected, but whose existence does have measurable effects. One of those effects is the Casimir effect. It is an attractive pressure between two flat, parallel metal plates placed very near to each other in a vacuum. The pressure is due to the reduced number of virtual particles between the plates. When the plates are very close, only particles of certain resonant wavelengths can exist between them. Thus, more particles on the outside push the plates together.

The point was to draw a possible parallel between human altrusim which is known to go beyond mere kinship selection and the chimp behaviors which also appear to go beyond kinship-selection. The discussion goes to the fact that humans and chimps share a common ancestor at the point where humans and chimps went their separate evolutionary pathways. One possibility is that such a common ancestor may have had the capacity to also be altruistic to individuals outside its kinship group. Or of course that chimps and humans both developed their respective altruistic behaviors independently after the branch point.  None of this negates the concept of biological altruism in the form of kinship selection which a geneticall based effect. Indeed the article recognizes that chimps DO exhibit kinship selection effects!

{"text": "The death penalty does not work as a deterrent, not because of people's analysis of it, but because it simply does not work. It may in fact increase the rate of violent crime.  FBI Report Reveals Murder Rate Rise in the South  According to the FBI's Preliminary Uniform Crime Report for 2002, the murder rate in the South increased by 2.1% while the murder rate in the Northeast decreased by almost 5%. The South accounts for 82% of all executions since 1976; the Northeast accounts for less than 1%. Read the report. (FBI Preliminary Uniform Crime Report 2002, June 16, 2003).  Four new studies on deterrence throw further doubt that there is any deterrent effect from sentencing people to death or executing people for homicide. The studies did find support for a brutalization effect. (RECAP Newsletter, National Death Penalty Developments, 12/99)  Capital Punishment and Deterrence: Examining the Effect of Executions on Murder in Texas. Authors John Sorenson, Robert Wrinkle, Victoria Brewer, and James Marquart examined executions in Texas between 1984 and 1997. They speculated that if a deterrent effect were to exist, it would be found in Texas because of the high number of death sentences and executions within the state. Using patterns in executions across the study period and the relatively steady rate of murders in Texas, the authors found no evidence of a deterrent effect. The study concluded that the number of executions was unrelated to murder rates in general, and that the number of executions was unrelated to felony rates. (45 Crime and Delinquency 481-93 (1999)).  Deterrence, Brutalization, and the Death Penalty: Another Examination of Oklahoma's Return to Capital Punishment. In this study, author William Bailey speculated that if executions had a deterrent effect in Oklahoma, it would be observable by comparing murder rates and rates of sub-types of murder, such as felony-murder, stranger robbery-related killings, stranger non-felony murder, and argument-related killings, before and after the resumption of executions. Bailey examined the period between 1989 and 1991 for total killings and sub-types of killing. After controlling for a number of variables, Bailey found that there was no evidence for a deterrent effect. He did, however, find that there was a significant increase in stranger killings and non-felony stranger killings after Oklahoma resumed executions after a 25-year moratorium. (36 Criminology 711-33 (1998)).  Effects of an Execution on Homicides in California. Author Ernie Thompson examined criminal homicides in Los Angeles before and after California's execution of Robert Harris in 1992, the state's first execution after a 25-year moratorium. Thompson found slight increases in homicides during the eight months following the execution. (3 Homicide Studies 129-150 (1999)).  The Geography of Execution: The Capital Punishment Quagmire in America. Keith Harries and Derral Cheatwood studied differences in homicides and violent crime in 293 pairs of counties. Counties were matched in pairs based on geographic location, regional context, historical development, demographic and economic variables. The pairs shared a contiguous border, but differed on use of capital punishment. The authors found no support for a deterrent effect of capital punishment at the county level comparing matched counties inside and outside states with capital punishment, with and without a death row population, and with and without executions. The authors did find higher violent crime rates in death penalty counties. (Rowman and Littlefiled Publishers, Lanham, MD (1997))  South Has Highest Murder Rate in 2001  According to data released on October 28 as part of the FBI's Uniform Crime Report for 2001, the South again has the highest murder rate of the four regions in the United States. The South was also the only region above the national average. In 2001, almost 80% of executions in the country occurred in the South. The report noted that the Texas crime rate rose 4% in 2001, nearly five times the national average, and the state posted a 7.6% increase in homicides. At the same time, the total number of executions in Texas is more than three times that of any other state in the nation. The Northeast, the region with the lowest murder rate, had no executions in 2001. (See DPIC's Execution Statistics, Crime in the United States, 2001, New York Times and Houston Chronicle, October 29, 2002)   REGION MURDER RATE PER 100,000 PEOPLE  Northeast 4.2  Midwest 5.3  West 5.5  South 6.7  National 5.6  - Crime in the United States, 2001  Homicide Rates Fall in Canada After Abolition of Death Penalty  The abolition of the death penalty in Canada in 1976 has not led to increased homicide rates. Statistics Canada reports that the number of homicides in Canada in 2001 (554) was 23% lower than the number of homicides in 1975 (721), the year before the death penalty was abolished. In addition, homicide rates in Canada are generally three times lower than homicide rates in the U.S., which uses the death penalty. For example, according to the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics, the homicide rate in the U.S. in 1999 was 5.7 per 100,000 population and the rate in Canada was only 1.8.

The Thompson and sawed off shotgun were not used by the US Army. Guess what? The Thompson was adpoted by the Army a few years later. So then, what does that mean? Judicial opinion is of the direction that military serviceable weapons are protected by the 2nd Amendment. What does that mean for the assault rifle ban?

Flash hiders can hide flash from the target. It's main purpose is to hide flash from the SHOOTER! The flash startles the shooter and makes bullets ballistically unstable:  \"Excessive muzzle flash happens when unburned powder ignites at the muzzle, causing turbulence behind the bullet with a detrimental effect on accuracy.\" - http://www.shootingsoftware.com/loadens.htm  Flash has more to do with the ammo than the attachment on the end. The Flash hidder ban has lowered target shooting scores more than protecting lives.  2) Magazine limit? Argued by anti-gunners to save lives. Argued to prevent rapid and large expendature of rounds down range upon victims. True, but how often do you hear that? When it does happen it is national news. The real threat is from guns that contain more 2 less than 4 bullets:  http://ip.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/abstract/9/2/151  The anti-gunners know this and are comming after your 6 shot revolvers next. They just wanted people to started getting used it to idea of banning bullet capacity.  So then. The ban on more than 10 bullets? It really does not do anything than give a false sense of security.

In fact, its first point is that today's cats have no problem reproducing for several generations on today's cooked food. The difference is that good owners don't feed their pets deficient diets.  The real irony here is that this experiment -- were it reliable -- would be the antithesis of supersport's Lamarckism. In order for supersport to be supported, the cats being fed inadequate diets would re-develop those broken pathways for manufacturing essential amino acids. Obviously, they did not. The only thing we see here is the effect of poor (i.e. positively malnutritive) diet.  We can conclude that supersport's Morton's demon is pretty much in full control.

{"text": "...and I wasn't disappointed :)  I don't know what 'chance as causality' is supposed to mean, but to speak of evolution being 'based on chance' is highly misleading.  If I have an accident on the way to work tomorrow morning, there will be a definite cause; a specific series of events leading up to it. We cannot guess what they might be. Nevertheless, we can still makes statements about the statistical likelihood of such an accident occurring, yes? Does that accurate statement of probability mean that my fate on the road is literally determined by a dice roll, that if my number comes up, I crash, with 'chance as causality'? Of course not. We are merely describing the likelihood of an event in a system of which we have imperfect knowledge. As our knowledge of the system increases, our assessment of that likelihood changes: if you know my age and gender, my driving habits, my route and how busy or quiet it is - all these things permit a more accurate assessment of the odds. If we had perfect knowledge of a deterministic system, the odds would be 1 or 0.  Similarly, every mutation that has ever occurred has had a definite proximate cause, and if we knew what they all were and what they would all be in the future, evolution would lie mapped out before us in all its detail. Nevertheless, in the absence of perfect knowledge of these individual causes we can still describe the occurrence of such events statistically, saying how long we might have to wait, or how many trials we might conduct in order to expect a given outcome. So to say that the evolution of the nylon bug, for instance, was based on chance is misleading: the evolution of the nylon bug was based on whatever proximate cause shuffled its DNA.  Correctly viewed, evolution is not a series of unlikely events, but a series of highly likely ones. It is highly likely, for instance, that some bacteria in a large colony would experience a mutation enabling the digestion of nylon. Sure - breaking that event down on a per-bacterium basis yields tiny probabilities, but why stop there? Why not break it down on a per-bacterium, per-microsecond basis? The chances just got even smaller! See? It's a silly way to think about it, because in the end it's the chance of the event occurring that matters, not some arbitrary deadline by which it must occur or cell to which it must occur.", "label": "fact"}

{"text": "oh it gets better....   Significant portions of this article are excerpted from Michael Z. Williamson's excellent and witty piece, It's amazing what one has to believe to believe in gun control\"   1. Banning guns works, which is why New York, DC, & Chicago cops need guns.  2. Washington DC's low murder rate of 69 per 100,000 is due to strict gun control, and Indianapolis' high murder rate of 9 per 100,000 is due to the lack of gun control.  3. Statistics showing high murder rates justify gun control but statistics showing increasing murder rates after gun control are \"just statistics.\"  4. The Brady Bill and the Assault Weapons Ban, both of which went into effect in 1994 are responsible for the decrease in violent crime rates, which have been declining since 1991.  5. We must get rid of guns because a deranged lunatic may go on a shooting spree at any time and anyone who would own a gun out of fear of such a lunatic is paranoid.  6. The more helpless you are the safer you are from criminals.  7. An intruder will be incapacitated by tear gas or oven spray, but if shot with a .357 Magnum will get angry and kill you.  8. A woman raped and strangled is morally superior to a woman with a smoking gun and a dead rapist at her feet.  9. When confronted by violent criminals, you should \"put up no defense -- give them what they want, or run\" (Handgun Control Inc. Chairman Pete Shields, Guns Don't Die - People Do, 1981, p.125).  10. The New England Journal of Medicine is filled with expert advice about guns; just like Guns & Ammo has some excellent treatises on heart surgery.  11. One should consult an automotive engineer for safer seatbelts, a civil engineer for a better bridge, a surgeon for internal medicine, a computer programmer for hard drive problems, and Sarah Brady for firearms expertise.  12. The 2nd Amendment, ratified in 1787, refers to the National Guard, which was created 130 years later, in 1917.  13. The National Guard, federally funded, with bases on federal land, using federally-owned weapons, vehicles, buildings and uniforms, punishing trespassers under federal law, is a \"state\" militia.  14. These phrases: \"right of the people peaceably to assemble,\" \"right of the people to be secure in their homes,\" \"enumerations herein of certain rights shall not be construed to disparage others retained by the people,\" and \"The powers not delegated herein are reserved to the states respectively, and to the people\" all refer to individuals, but \"the right of the people to keep and bear arm\" refers to the state.  15. \"The Constitution is strong and will never change.\" But we should ban and seize all guns thereby violating the 2nd, 4th, and 5th Amendments to that Constitution.  16. Rifles and handguns aren't necessary to national defense! Of course, the army has hundreds of thousands of them.  17. Private citizens shouldn't have handguns, because they aren't \"military weapons\", but private citizens shouldn't have \"assault rifles\", because they are military weapons.  18. In spite of waiting periods, background checks, finger printing, government forms, etc., guns today are too readily available, which is responsible for recent school shootings. In the 1940's, 1950's and1960's, anyone could buy guns at hardware stores, army surplus stores, gas stations, variety stores, Sears mail order, no waiting, no background check, no fingerprints, no government forms and there were no school shootings.  19. The NRA's attempt to run a \"don't touch\" campaign about kids handling guns is propaganda, but the anti-gun lobby's attempt to run a \"don't touch\" campaign is responsible social activity.  20. Guns are so complex that special training is necessary to use them properly, and so simple to use that they make murder easy.  21. A handgun, with up to 4 controls, is far too complex for the typical adult to learn to use, as opposed to an automobile that only has 20.  22. Women are just as intelligent and capable as men but a woman with a gun is \"an accident waiting to happen\" and gun makers' advertisements aimed at women are \"preying on their fears.\"  23. Ordinary people in the presence of guns turn into slaughtering butchers but revert to normal when the weapon is removed.  24. Guns cause violence, which is why there are so many mass killings at gun shows.  25. A majority of the population supports gun control, just like a majority of the population supported owning slaves.  26. Any self-loading small arm can legitimately be considered to be a \"weapon of mass destruction\" or an \"assault weapon.\"  27. Most people can't be trusted, so we should have laws against guns, which most people will abide by because they can be trusted.  28. The right of Internet pornographers to exist cannot be questioned because it is constitutionally protected by the Bill of Rights, but the use of handguns for self defense is not really protected by the Bill of Rights.  29. Free speech entitles one to own newspapers, transmitters, computers, and typewriters, but self-defense only justifies bare hands.  30. The ACLU is good because it uncompromisingly defends certain parts of the Constitution, and the NRA is bad, because it defends other parts of the Constitution.  31. Charlton Heston, a movie actor as president of the NRA is a cheap lunatic who should be ignored, but Michael Douglas, a movie actor as a representative of Handgun Control, Inc. is an ambassador for peace who is entitled to an audience at the UN arms control summit.  32. Police operate with backup within groups, which is why they need larger capacity pistol magazines than do \"civilians\" who must face criminals alone and therefore need less ammunition.  33. We should ban \"Saturday Night Specials\" and other inexpensive guns because it's not fair that poor people have access to guns too.  34. Police officers have some special Jedi-like mastery over hand guns that private citizens can never hope to obtain.  35. Private citizens don't need a gun for self-protection because the police are there to protect them even though the Supreme Court says the police are not responsible for their protection.  36. Citizens don't need to carry a gun for personal protection but police chiefs, who are desk-bound administrators who work in a building filled with cops, need a gun.  37. \"Assault weapons\" have no purpose other than to kill large numbers of people. The police need assault weapons. You do not.  38. When Microsoft pressures its distributors to give Microsoft preferential promotion, that's bad; but when the Federal government pressures cities to buy guns only from Smith & Wesson, that's good.  39. Trigger locks do not interfere with the ability to use a gun for defensive purposes, which is why you see police officers with one on their duty weapon.  40. Handgun Control, Inc. says they want to \"keep guns out of the wrong hands.\" Guess what? You have the wrong hands", "label": "fact"}
{"text": "--------  At first glance this statute seems to merely track the now-expired federal AW ban, and I would watch out to see if its supporters are selling it as such. It is in reality far more restrictive than the expired federal ban! I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know if it is being sold as merely a \u00e2\u0080\u009ccommon sense state enactment of the old federal ban that expired and no longer protects us,\u00e2\u0080\u009d but if it is, then here is why that argument is fraudulent: The old federal ban was far less restrictive because it defined an AW (in addition to some firearms deemed automatically an AW) as having 2 or more of the cosmetic features, while this new statute says it needs only 1 cosmetic feature. That is a significant difference which allows this proposed law to capture many more firearms than the old federal ban. It looks like the old federal ban definitions were used as a template for this new statute, but whoever wrote it decided to change it down to 1 offending cosmetic feature knowing full well it would ban far more firearms. If I were you I would let my legislator know this difference.   For comparison, here are the AW definitions from the old federal AW ban:  18 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7 921  is a listing of how terms are defined in the firearms offenses portion of the Code, and it defines a federally banned AW as follows:  (30) The term \"semiautomatic assault weapon\" means -  (A) any of the firearms, or copies or duplicates of the firearms in any caliber, known as -  (i) Norinco, Mitchell, and Poly Technologies Avtomat Kalashnikovs (all models);  (ii) Action Arms Israeli Military Industries UZI and Galil;  (iii) Beretta Ar70 (SC-70);  (iv) Colt AR-15;  (v) Fabrique National FN/FAL, FN/LAR, and FNC;  (vi) SWD M-10, M-11, M-11/9, and M-12;  (vii) Steyr AUG;  (viii) INTRATEC TEC-9, TEC-DC9 and TEC-22; and  (ix) revolving cylinder shotguns, such as (or similar to) the Street Sweeper and Striker 12;  (B) a semiautomatic rifle that has an ability to accept a detachable magazine and has at least 2 of -  (i) a folding or telescoping stock;  (ii) a pistol grip that protrudes conspicuously beneath the action of the weapon;  (iii) a bayonet mount;  (iv) a flash suppressor or threaded barrel designed to accommodate a flash suppressor; and  (v) a grenade launcher;  (C) a semiautomatic pistol that has an ability to accept a detachable magazine and has at least 2 of -  (i) an ammunition magazine that attaches to the pistol outside of the pistol grip;  (ii) a threaded barrel capable of accepting a barrel extender, flash suppressor, forward handgrip, or silencer;  (iii) a shroud that is attached to, or partially or completely encircles, the barrel and that permits the shooter to hold the firearm with the nontrigger hand without being burned;  (iv) a manufactured weight of 50 ounces or more when the pistol is unloaded; and  (v) a semiautomatic version of an automatic firearm; and  (D) a semiautomatic shotgun that has at least 2 of -  (i) a folding or telescoping stock;  (ii) a pistol grip that protrudes conspicuously beneath the action of the weapon;  (iii) a fixed magazine capacity in excess of 5 rounds; and  (iv) an ability to accept a detachable magazine.  (4) for any person, other than a licensed importer, licensed manufacturer, licensed dealer, or licensed collector, to transport in interstate or foreign commerce any destructive device, machinegun (as defined in section 5845 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986)  [this being the tie-in to the NFA tax ban on machine guns]  Note, by the way, that these definitions still exist in the US Code and have NOT been repealed or have expired.  What expired was a portion of another statute, which made it a crime to possess these weapons. For reference, that statute is 18 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7 922  [which lists several acts committed with firearms considered to be crimes. The AW ban added the following language, which has since expired but still exists in the Code]:  (v)(1) It shall be unlawful for a person to manufacture, transfer, or possess a semiautomatic assault weapon.  (2) Paragraph (1) shall not apply to the possession or transfer of any semiautomatic assault weapon otherwise lawfully possessed under Federal law on the date of the enactment of this subsection.  (3) Paragraph (1) shall not apply to -  (A) any of the firearms, or replicas or duplicates of the firearms, specified in Appendix A to this section, as such firearms were manufactured on October 1, 1993;  (B) any firearm that -  (i) is manually operated by bolt, pump, lever, or slide action;  (ii) has been rendered permanently inoperable; or  (iii) is an antique firearm;  (C) any semiautomatic rifle that cannot accept a detachable magazine that holds more than 5 rounds of ammunition; or  (D) any semiautomatic shotgun that cannot hold more than 5 rounds of ammunition in a fixed or detachable magazine.  The fact that a firearm is not listed in Appendix A shall not be construed to mean that paragraph (1) applies to such firearm. No firearm exempted by this subsection may be deleted from Appendix A so long as this subsection is in effect.  (4) Paragraph (1) shall not apply to -  (A) the manufacture for, transfer to, or possession by the United States or a department or agency of the United States or a State or a department, agency, or political subdivision of a State, or a transfer to or possession by a law enforcement officer employed by such an entity for purposes of law enforcement (whether on or off duty);  (B) the transfer to a licensee under title I of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 for purposes of establishing and maintaining an on-site physical protection system and security organization required by Federal law, or possession by an employee or contractor of such licensee on-site for such purposes or off-site for purposes of licensee-authorized training or transportation of nuclear materials;  (C) the possession, by an individual who is retired from service with a law enforcement agency and is not otherwise prohibited from receiving a firearm, of a semiautomatic assault weapon transferred to the individual by the agency upon such retirement; or  (D) the manufacture, transfer, or possession of a semiautomatic assault weapon by a licensed manufacturer or licensed importer for the purposes of testing or experimentation authorized by the Secretary.

{"text": "On the face of it, the implication is that this kind of thing happens all the time; that everywhere you look, stress-induced hypermutation is occurring, and along with it adaptive mutations are occurring disproportionately often - that this is part and parcel of everyday evolution.  The ardour with which this evidence is brandished is, however, misleading. In only a handful of studies, using specific strains of bacteria with specific genetic features under specific environmental circumstances, have specific adaptive mutations seemed to occur with anomalous frequency. There is no suggestion that these cases are in any way generally representative, and even if the results were being interpreted correctly, the idea that they constitute evidence for a pan-species mechanism of internally directed evolution is, unfortunately, wishful thinking.  But what of these rare anomalous cases? The most famous was reported by J. Cairns and P. L. Foster, in which a dish of starving, non-growing E-coli (a particular strain with a Lac- mutation) appeared to preferentially induce a reversion mutation (to Lac+) in order to enable growth when the only source of energy was lactose. Moreover, the mutation did not occur with such frequency if lactose was not present, if there was another growth-inhibiting factor in play, or if food sources other than lactose were available. On top of that, although the adapted bacteria showed evidence of accumulating other non-selected mutations, it was nowhere near enough to explain the rate of adaptive mutation, and the bacteria which didn't adapt showed no accumulation of unselected mutations at all!  Understandably, this looked to them, and other people at the time, like a pretty cut'n'dried example of an environmentally-or-organismically induced adaptive mutation.  However, the nagging problem remained that this event was completely unprecedented, and was not observed in the general case of bacteria under starvation conditions. Why was this strain of bacteria so good at inducing this particular reversion mutation in just those circumstances?  The answer, as it turned out, was that the experimental assumption of 'no growth' taking place in the e-coli colony was in error.  The strain of e-coli used in the experiment had a 'leaky' (inefficient) mutant Lac allele, with only 1% to 2% of the normal ability to process lactose. That 1% to 2% was then deliberately 'smothered' by the experimenters through the addition of scavenger cells which mopped up the product of what little lactose the e-coli could process, effectively halting their growth. Because the later, visible growing colonies of e-coli had a reversion mutation to lac+, the experimenters deduced that mutation was required for growth to be possible.  However, what they did not take into account at the time was that during normal growth prior to incubation on the test medium, a small proportion of the e-coli colony experienced a duplication of the leaky lac gene. This mutation conferred no advantage - until the colony was plated on lactose. Now, the second copy of the gene increased the total amount of lactose they could process beyond the ability of the scavenger cells to inhibit growth, and the e-coli could (slowly) grow and divide.  Within these slow-growing microcolonies, selection favoured those cells which experienced further lac- duplications. And the more lac- duplications a cell has, the more likely one of them will experience a reversion mutation to lac+, explaining the apparently anomalous frequency of that particular mutation. When this happens, cell growth rate jumps considerably - but now it is the additional lac- genes which are holding the organism back, destabilising the chromosome and tying up resources which could be more efficiently processed by the lac+ gene. Selection now favours those lac+ revertants who lose the unstable lac- duplications. By the time the microcolonies become visible to the naked eye, they consist almost entirely of lac+ revertants.  This hypothesis agrees with all observations related to the earlier experiments, and was verified in a number of ways, including repeating the experiment with a colony composed entirely of duplicate lac- bacteria, increasing the number of microcolonies 100-fold, which tallies with the ~1% background rate of chromosomal duplications in those bacteria. Also, bacteria in the late-arriving microcolonies were observed to possess residual duplicate lac- genes.  In short, the results of the experiment agree completely with classical evolutionary theory.  It should be noted, by the way, that in addition to the late-arriving 'directed mutation' microcolonies that causes such a stir, the original experimenters also observed the expected number of early-appearing colonies from pre-plating revertant mutants, a la L&D.  EDIT: Reading further around the subject, it seems no stress-induced hypermutable state was involved either. Apparently, 10-20% of the bacteria with lac- duplications also possessed 'dinB' (a mutation-promoting gene apparently, though it's beyond the scope of my research here) on the same plasmid. The mutagen 'came along for the ride' so to speak, as selection favoured the duplication of that section of DNA, and induced hgher rates of mutation in - yep - 10-20% of the adaptive population.  So not only was the hypermutational state of that subpopulation not the cause of the adaptive mutation (clearly, since the other 80-90% of adaptation happened without it), it was actually harmful.  Live n learn!  2ND EDIT: The same experiment yields similar results with lac- situated within the chromosome itself, only with 100-fold fewer colonies, reflecting the lower incidence of chromosomal duplication and reversion events in comparison with plasmids.", "label": "fact"}

{"text": "I think that Believer may be referring to microbe to man evolution (i.e. simple life to more complex life). Your definition is not entirely accurate and misleading. By this, massive ammounts of new information must be added to the genome of the microbe to get it to \"evolve\" to a human, about 999 books each consisting of 500 pages fine print of information must be added to change a microbe to a human. That's a lot of information isn't it? Now where does all that information come from? It can't come from a Creator, there's no Creator according to atheistic evolutionism. Evolutionists say that this new information comes from accidental changes in the DNA when the information is being copied, these acidents are called mutations.   Is this true though? Do mutations produce the new information required by microbe to man evolution? Dr Lee Spetner, an Israeli biophysicist says that there is not one mutation that one can point to that on the molecular level can be seen to increase the information in the genome. They actually all turn out to reduce the information in the genome. Let's take the example of the Totally Naked Rooster, the TNR mutant. What has the mutation done? It has obviously destroyed the information for making feathers. Has the rooster ever been improved by the mutation? From the point of view of the chook farmer, probably yes, because no feathers - no plucking required. But what about from the point of view of the rooster? Well, he's going to freeze in winter and fry in summer, not much of an improvement for the rooster. This mutation has destroyed the information for making feathers. It can also be shown that anti-biotic resistance is the result of an information losing mutation, and many other evidences of evolution in action are also the result of information losing mutations - which matches perfectly with the creationary model, i.e. varriation within a kind. See, evolution can cope with the occassional down-hill mutation, but they really need a lot and a lot of up-hill, information gaining mutations if they are going to change a reptile into a bird, for example, and change a microbe into a human over eons of years. The problem is, we just don't see these information gaining mutations occuring at all today.  Now natural selection is also supposed to be the hero of the plot to, right? Well, actually, natural selection also results in a loss of information for a certain population. We'll take the example of a population of dogs that are taken to a very cold environment with varrying fur (or hair) sizes. The population consists of the following fur sizes:  LL - Long fur.  Ll - Medium fur sizes.  ll - Short fur sizes.  where L = long fur gene, and l = short fur gene.  Obviously, the cold will kill of those dogs that are not fit to handle the cold whether. The poor dogs with short fur sizes would be the first to go, then followed by the medium fur sized dogs - that makes sense doesn't it? Take them to a place like Antartica. Over short time, only the dogs with long fur sizes would survive. Our surviving population consists of the following fur sizes:  LL - Long fur.  We started off with a or variety of fur sizes in the population, but, as you can see, the short haired gene was eliminated from the environment by natural selection. Thus the population has lost information. So natural selection does not add information to the population, it erases information that disadvantages a population from living in a certain environment, such as the short haired gene (l) in this case.  Hence, neither mutations nor natural selection adds any new information to the genome.", "label": "fact"}

{"text": "Following the original purpose of this thread, I will summarize my own views on abortion. (Note, this is copied from an older survey on abortion beliefs - a thread in the abortion forum called \"Survey of views on abortion\"):  For me, the question of abortion rights comes down to a balance between the rights of the mother and the rights of the fetus. On the side of the rights of the mother, there is a very important right to the control over one's own body and to not be forced to carry something as important and taxing as a pregnancy against one's will. Some may say that, in agreeing to have sex, a woman is agreeing to a pregnancy, but I strongly disagree. A pregnancy is a possible outcome of sex but only has a very small percentage chance if birth control is used. It would be like saying that you agree to be mugged if you walk in a bad neighborhood. The great majority of sex acts - for both married and unmarried women, religious or non-religious, conservative or liberal - are not done for the purposes of having children but are done for emotional and/or purely physical reasons. Pregnancy is the goal for only a minority of sex acts. So, women are not agreeing to a pregnancy when they have sex. In the case of unwanted pregnancies, it is a significant burden that they never agreed to. If they are forced to carry such a pregnancy, it would be a strong imposition against the rights over their own bodies.  On the other hand, one has the rights of the fetus. What rights the fetus has depends on your belief system and priorities. For me, the most important thing when it comes to the rights of any human being is whether or not there is a mental existence - at least a rudimentary mind. I believe that I did not exist until I started to mentally exist and that applies to all others. My view is that, once a mental existence begins, the right to life of a fetus kicks in and takes priority over the mother's rights over her own body, under most circumstances. The neurological view is that a mind cannot exist before the third trimester. Therefore, I would allow abortion-on-demand for the first and second trimester and restrict it in the third trimester. For that third trimester, I would limit abortions to those that are done to mitigate a significant risk to the mother's life or physical or mental health (ex. leading to, say, paralysis or strong possibility of suicide, etc.) and, in case of severe incurable deformations of the fetus discovered late, to end the life of a fetus that would otherwise strongly suffer (i.e. mercy killing). Otherwise, I believe abortions should be restricted. If a woman has not decided on an abortion by the third trimester, she should have to carry the pregnancy to term (minus the perviously mentioned exceptions). She would have had ample time to decide.  Lastly, here are a couple of links which describe the neurological view of a mind not existing before the third trimester:  Part 4 of http://www.2think.org/abortion.shtml   http://7e.devbio.com/article.php?ch=21&id=162", "label": "fact"}

{"text": "Hey, bring it on. A month ago, I read over your 'failed prophecies' and if you are ready to listen, there is no problem explaining what happened with Nebuchadnezzar and Egypt.  It is mature fare and hard for even Christians to accept sometimes, but the long and short of it is this: you don't even begin to know the God you are dealing with.   If you give me a space of time to get things together, I can introduce you to a being who is so much like you that you will almost be fooled into feeling that you're his \"buddy\" then I will introduce you to the same being who can tear you to pieces if he chooses (Ps. 50)  Here's a hint though about what happened in Egypt: God changed his mind. But you didn't know he could do that? You would be surprised how much like you he really is. He changed his mind several times in the text of the Bible: Abraham tried to get Him to but couldn't get Him to stop his destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, God was out to kill Moses' sons, but Moses quickly circumcised them and God changed his mind, also Moses succeeded in changing God's mind when Moses learned that He was out to destroy the Israelites, God was determined to level Ninevah but after Jonah preached He changed his mind because the people repented, God spoke to the prophet Jeremiah saying : When I pronounce judgment on a peoples but they later turn from their sins, I will change my mind concerning the judgment I had determined on them.   But be careful - when He is set on doing something, it gets done. Just when you think you have a \"pal\" in God, he says something like this to the prophet Ezekiel: when a land sins against Me, though Noah and Daniel and Job are in it, they will deliver but their own souls.  Even righteous Noah couldn't stay the hand of the Almighty when He was dead set on destroying the first world.   Real quick: one of the major ways God judges a people group is via another wicked people or wicked king. Happens time and time again in scripture. Don't have time to elaborate right now. Nebuchadnezzar was a wicked king and in God's hand he was simply a pawn to use to punish other nations. So while God is using him to punish Egypt, He is punishing Nebuchadnezzar and his nation as well. Get it? Is it too mature for you? Don't believe it? Too bad....it's true. God will bring a nation to full dominance and power in order to punish other nations. When He is through using them, He will often turn His wrath on the punishing nation who was His original \"servant\" so to speak. This is mature teaching. Most Christians don't like it. Too bad....it's true. You don't even begin to understand the God you are dealing with and the One you are rebelling against and the One you are defying day by day. One day, He will be finished with you as well. Psalms gives your day of prophecy like this (God is speaking): All these things you have done and I kept silent. You thought I was altogether like you, but I will come and and rebuke you and tear you to pieces. Ps 50:21  Know what happened with your 'failed prophecy?' God changed His mind!

I can definitely see how you may doubt Dr Humphreys new Cosmology, that was a pretty heavy attack, the much of it went zip, right over my head. But I just can't help but feel that they mis-interpreted several lines and are using some straw man attacks. I personally cannot see anything wrong with his arguments, although if there is, he has given way for a new area of cosmology, a Creationist Cosmology.   I hope that this helps clear up this little problem regarding \"Starlight and Time\". Got to go,  Matt.", "label": "fact"}

{"text": "Actually, you have been lied to here from my knowledge. The fossil record does not show \"in-between types\". Darwin said that the absence of such intermediates was the \"most obvious and serious objection\" against his theory. Nearly 150 years later, Dr David Raup, the head of one of the great museums in America, said that the situation concerning missing links \"hasn't changed much\" and that \"we have even fewer examples of evolutionary transition than we had in Darwins times.\" The Late Dr Colin Patterson was Senior Paleontologist at the British Museum of Natural History as well an being an evolutionist and a fossil expert. He wrote a significant book on evolution - but when someone asked him why he did not show any pictures of in-between forms in his book, he wrote the following:  \"I fully agree with your comments on the lack of direct illustration of evolutinoary transitinos in my book. If I knew of any, fossil or living, I would certainly have included them. You suggest that an artist should be used to visualise such transformations, but where would he get the informatino from? I could not, honestly, provide it, and if I were to leave it to artistic licence, would htat not mislead the reader? I wrote the text of my book four years ago [in the book he does talk of his belief in some transitions - my dialogue]. If I were to write it now, I think the book would be rather different. Gradualism is a concept I believe in, not just because of Darwin's authority, but because my understanding of genetics seems to demand it. Yet [famous fossil expert stephen J.] Gould and the American Museum people are hard to contradict when they say there are no transitinoal fossils. As a palaeontologist myself, I am much occupied with the philosophical problems of identifying ancestral forms in the fossil record. You say that I should at least \"show a photo of the fossil form which each type of organism was derived\". I will lay it on teh line - there is not one such fossil for which one could make a watertight argument.\"  Patterson came under fire from fellow evolutionists for having made this and similar candid admissinos, and attempted to soften the remarks retrospectively. However, the language is clear and unmistakable.   Stephen Jay Gould, evolutionist said this: \"The lack of transitional fossils is the trade secret of palaeontology\". All quotes came from \"The Revised Quote Book\". You interestingly bring up human evolution. Human evolution is blank and filled with a tonne of holes that would sink the Titanic. Let us go through the basic evolutionary candidates:  * Australopithecines (Lucy fossil type):- Dr Charles Oxnard is one of a growing number of evolutionist anatomists who have examined vast numbers of measurements by computerized multivariate analysis (an objective method that does not  depend on preconceived beliefs about ancestry), do not believ that these creatuers are human ancestors. He states that although initally it was though that they were human-like or at least intermediate between apes and humans, the reality is that they \"differ more from both humans and African apes than do these two living groups from each other. THe australopithecines are unique.\" Recent CAT scans of the bony labyrinth which once housed their organ of balance have shown conclusively that they did not  habitually walk upright, as many still insist.   * Homo Habblis:- Many scientists (evolutionary scientists included) are now recognising that Habblis is a waste bin of two or more creatures, and hence, is an invalid category. Even so, the CAT scans have determined that Habblis was less  bipedal than Australopithecines. So we are actually \"de-evolving\" if you will.   * Homo Erectus and Neandertals:- Once again, CAT scans have shown that Erectus and Neandertals walked up right just like us. They would be able to run,hop, skip, jump, etc, and do all the things that we do today. Many scientists now classify erectus and neandertals as \"true humans\". And it has been known that Neandertal types had been living at the same time as \"modern\" types. Tools found on an Indonesian island in associatino with stegodon (an extinct elephant) remains have cause evolutionist Dr Alan Thorne to suggest that these so-called \"pre-human ancestors\" had seafaring skills and technology. As far back as 1993 he said, \"They're not [i.e. shouldn't be called] Homo erecus, they're people\". This quote came from the Australian, 19 August 1993.  If one uses the evolutionists' own timescales and criteria for classification and plots all \"hominid\" fossil discoveries on a chart, it will readily be seen that the idea of any evolutionary sequence is a shambles. (M. Lubenow, \"Bones of Contention\").  I found it interesting that you got your information from talkorigins.com. They totally do not know what they are talking about. In one article that I saw regarding SNRs they totally changed the scientific evidence to suit their own theory, as for one, the article was not written by an educated person, nor did it have any references - unlike the article on SNRs that was written by Answers in Genesis. Many of their arguments, like the one on your link can be easliy refuted. Other articles employ what is known as the \"straw man\" argument tactic, i.e. using an argument that can be easily refuted and one that is not held by anyone.   If evolution is true, than we should expect to find millions and millions of fossils of in-between forms, right? Well, the truth is, we don't. Some evolutionists claim there are some - maybe a handful - of such in-between fossil types (highly, highly, highly debatable). Other leading experts have rejected soe or all of these. What is not well known is that the interesting fossil creature Archaeopteryx, often used as an example of a transitional form between reptiles and birds shows none of the crucial transitinoal structures which would strongly argue for \"transitional\" status. The feathers are fully formed, and the wings are proper wings. It has the backward-facing claw and curved feet characteristic of perching birds. It wasmost definitely not, as some would reconstruct it, a running feathered dinosaur.   In fact, the same can be shown to be true for whale evolution animals such as the Ambulocetus and the Basilosaurs. These are not evolutionary transitional forms, as you are often told. Many evolutionists do not even acknowledge them, but this does not mean that they don't believe in their theory.  So in this respect, the fossil record does not show evolution as you are commonly told. In fact, it tells us that things breed true to their kind, i.e. horses produce horses, cats produce cats and so on.  You than go onto challange:", "label": "fact"}

Here's an excerpt:  Climatologists Reject Media Claims of Global Warming Consensus  \"[I]n November 2004, German climatologist Hans von Storch, director of the GKSS Institute for Coastal Research (IfK) in Geesthacht, Germany, foresaw that claims of alarmist consensus would be made by nonscientists ...\"  Environment & Climate News > August 2005  Environment   Environment > Climate: Consensus   Email a Friend  Written By: Alan Caruba  Published In: Environment & Climate News > August 2005  Publication date: 08/01/2005  Publisher: The Heartland Institute  Leading climatologists spent the month of June fighting false proclamations from non-scientists claiming scientists have reached agreement that catastrophic global warming is occurring.  Alarmists Claim Debate Over  On June 1, California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger (R) claimed \"the debate is over\" and global warming alarmists' predictions had carried the day.  The Natural Resources Defense Council on June 9 declared, \"The world's leading scientists now agree that global warming is real and is happening right now. According to their forecasts, extreme changes in climate could produce a future in which erratic and chaotic weather, melting ice caps and rising sea levels usher in an era of drought, crop failure, famine, flood and mass extinctions.\"  On June 13, USA Today declared, \"The debate's over: Globe is Warming.\" In support of its claim, the newspaper cited the positions of some left-leaning religious groups, some corporations who will reap a financial windfall from a switch to alternative fuel sources, and some politicians.  Scientists Disagree  While each of the above claims from non-scientists received significant media coverage, leading climatologists spent the month of June rebutting such proclamations.  Atmospheric physicist S. Fred Singer, professor emeritus of environmental sciences at the University of Virginia and former director of the U.S. Weather Satellite Service, sent a letter to the editor of USA Today directly refuting its claim. \"Your editorial ... claim[s] the global warming debate is over. Not so,\" wrote Singer.  Singer wrote, \"Sea level will continue to rise by only seven inches per century as it has for thousands of years no matter what we do or what the EPA [U.S. Environmental Protection Agency] says. And temperatures in the next 100 years will likely rise by less than one degree F--not exactly a catastrophe.\"  Added Singer in a subsequent letter to the Canadian media, \"Thousands of scientists from many countries now fully understand that Kyoto and other efforts to control human emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) are ineffective and entirely unfounded scientifically.  \"Even if you ignore the enormous cost of Kyoto (estimated recently by Prof. George Taylor of Oregon State University--see http://www.sitewave.net/news/s49p628.htm--at one trillion U.S. dollars a year for full implementation in OECD countries), climate science research is rapidly moving AWAY from the hypothesis that the human release of greenhouse gases, specifically CO2, is in any way significantly contributing to global climate change.\"  Sun Called Primary Cause  \"If we just look at the historical data, there is a scientific consensus that the global mean temperature has risen modestly during the twentieth century,\" said Myron Ebell, director of global warming and environmental policy at the Competitive Enterprise Institute. \"The impacts have been small and probably beneficial in aggregate. This historical data puts the onus of demonstration on those who think this gradual warming trend will accelerate and lead to dire consequences.\"  The controlling driver of global temperature fluctuations, according to Dr. Benny Peiser of England's John Moore's University, is solar ray activity. \"Six eminent researchers from the Russian Academy of Science and the Israel Space Agency have just published a startling paper in one of the world's leading space science journals. The team of solar physicists claims to have come up with compelling evidence that changes in cosmic ray intensity and variations in solar activity have been driving much of the Earth's climate,\" Peiser was quoted as saying in the May 17 National Post.  Moreover, reports Peiser, Jan Veizer, one of Canada's top earth scientists, published a comprehensive review of recent findings and concluded, \"empirical observations on all time scales point to celestial phenomena as the principal driver of climate, with greenhouse gases acting only as potential amplifiers.\"  Added Peiser, \"In fact, the explicit and implicit rejection of the 'consensus' is not restricted to individual scientists. It also includes distinguished scientific organizations such as the Russian Academy of Science and the U.S. Association of State Climatologists, both of which are highly skeptical of the whole idea.\"  Heartland Institute - Article  And here's more:  Renowned Scientist Defects From Belief in Global Warming \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Caps Year of Vindication for Skeptics  October 17, 2006  October 17, 2006  Washington DC - One of the most decorated French geophysicists has converted from a believer in manmade catastrophic global warming to a climate skeptic. This latest defector from the global warming camp caps a year in which numerous scientific studies have bolstered the claims of climate skeptics. Scientific studies that debunk the dire predictions of human-caused global warming have continued to accumulate and many believe the new science is shattering the media-promoted scientific \u00e2\u0080\u009cconsensus\u00e2\u0080\u009d on climate alarmism.  Claude Allegre, a former government official and an active member of France\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Socialist Party, wrote an editorial on September 21, 2006 in the French newspaper L'Express titled \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Snows of Kilimanjaro\u00e2\u0080\u009d (For English Translation, click here: U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works ) detailing his newfound skepticism about manmade global warming. See: http://www.lexpress.fr/idees/tribune...asp?ida=451670 Allegre wrote that the \u00e2\u0080\u009ccause of climate change remains unknown\u00e2\u0080\u009d and pointed out that Kilimanjaro is not losing snow due to global warming, but to local land use and precipitation changes. Allegre also pointed out that studies show that Antarctic snowfall rate has been stable over the past 30 years and the continent is actually gaining ice.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cFollowing the month of August experienced by the northern half of France, the prophets of doom of global warming will have a lot on their plate in order to make our fellow countrymen swallow their certitudes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Allegre wrote. He also accused proponents of manmade catastrophic global warming of being motivated by money, noting that \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe ecology of helpless protesting has become a very lucrative business for some people!\u00e2\u0080\u009d  Allegre, a member of both the French and U.S. Academy of Sciences, had previously expressed concern about manmade global warming. \"By burning fossil fuels, man enhanced the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere which has raised the global mean temperature by half a degree in the last century,\" Allegre wrote 20 years ago. In addition, Allegre was one of 1500 scientists who signed a November 18, 1992 letter titled \u00e2\u0080\u009cWorld Scientists' Warning to Humanity\u00e2\u0080\u009d in which the scientists warned that global warming\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cpotential risks are very great.\u00e2\u0080\u009d See: Warning to Humanity  Allegre has authored more than 100 scientific articles, written 11 books and received numerous scientific awards including the Goldschmidt Medal from the Geochemical Society of the United States.  Allegre's conversion to a climate skeptic comes at a time when global warming alarmists have insisted that there is a \u00e2\u0080\u009cconsensus\u00e2\u0080\u009d about manmade global warming. Proponents of global warming have ratcheted up the level of rhetoric on climate skeptics recently.

University of California, Irvine, USA.  It has been proposed that modern humans descended from a single woman, the \"mitochondrial Eve\" who lived in Africa 100,000 to 200,000 years ago. The human immune system DRB1 genes are extremely polymorphic, with gene lineages that coalesce into an ancestor who lived around 60 million years ago, a time before the divergence of the apes from the Old World monkeys. The theory of gene coalescence suggests that, throughout the last 60 million years, human ancestral populations had an effective size of 100,000 individuals or greater. Molecular evolution data favor the African origin of modern humans, but the weight of the evidence is against a population bottleneck before their emergence.

What the fossil record does show is cases where, over time, modifications can be seen in animals morphology. There is also the fact you can find animals which are 'almost' another type of animal. A good example is Synapsids (otherwise known as 'Mammal-like reptiles'). The fossil record provides data which is best explained by the ToE, rather than 'Goddidit'. The argument between ToE and ID is not something in which the fossil record can be involved.  As far as I can tell, you don't talk about God as the personalised deity that most mainstream christian traditions talk about. In fact you seem to have a rather 'hippy-ish' view in that God is an energy. Just so you know, the idea that humans die when seeing Gods goes back at least as far as the ancient Greeks. Zeus killed one of his lovers when she demanded to see him in his true form (just by the power revealed in him). I think she was the mother of Perseus or something....

In Heller Stevens abandons his belief in Roe's \"prenumbra\" theory, that the Bill of Rights is just a rough outline of liberty interests that stand as examples of many others. I endorse Justice Harlan's dissent in Poe without Stevens' recent equivocation and find it to be a compelling argument in constitutional interpretation, since elevated to the opinion of the Court in a case which Stevens concurred:  \"Neither the Bill of Rights nor the specific practices of States at the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment marks the outer limits of the substantive sphere of liberty which the Fourteenth Amendment protects. See U.S. Const., Amdt. 9. As the second Justice Harlan recognized: '[T]he full scope of the liberty guaranteed by the Due Process Clause cannot be found in or limited by the precise terms of the specific guarantees elsewhere provided in the Constitution. This `liberty\u00c2\u00b4 is not a series of isolated points pricked out in terms of the taking of property; the freedom of speech, press, and religion; the right to keep and bear arms; the freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures; and so on. It is a rational continuum which, broadly speaking, includes a freedom from all substantial arbitrary impositions and purposeless restraints, . . . and which also recognizes, what a reasonable and sensitive judgment must, that certain interests require particularly careful scrutiny of the state needs asserted to justify their abridgment.'\"  Casey v. Planned Parenthood, 505 U.S. 833, 848 (1992)  This famous exposition is a long standing favorite of Stevens. He cited it in his dissent in Albright v. Oliver, 510 U.S. 266, 306-07 (1994). But he abandons his relationship with these ideals in Heller? Give me a break . . .  Who's sacrificing his principles for policy? At least Scalia's error results in an outcome that is consistent with his fundamental beliefs. That can not be said for Stevens.

The past couple of days have uncovered some shocking revelations about the baloney practices that pass as sound science about climate change.  It was announced Thursday afternoon that computer hackers had obtained 160 megabytes of e-mails from the Climate Research Unit (CRU) at the University of East Anglia (UEA) in England. Those e-mails involved communication among many scientific researchers and policy advocates with similar ideological positions all across the world. Those purported authorities were brazenly discussing the destruction and hiding of data that did not support global-warming claims.  Professor Phil Jones, the head of the Climate Research Unit, and professor Michael E. Mann at Pennsylvania State University, who has been an important scientist in the climate debate, have come under particular scrutiny. Among his e-mails, Mr. Jones talked to Mr. Mann about the \"trick of adding in the real temps to each series ... to hide the decline [in temperature].\"  Mr. Mann admitted that he was party to this conversation and lamely explained to the New York Times that \"scientists often used the word 'trick' to refer to a good way to solve a problem 'and not something secret.' \" Though the liberal New York newspaper apparently buys this explanation, we have seen no benign explanation that justifies efforts by researchers to skew data on so-called global-warming \"to hide the decline.\" Given the controversies over the accuracy of Mr. Mann's past research, it is surprising his current explanations are accepted so readily.  Here's more on this travesty: The Global Warming Scam Notice that the IPCC which has been the source for global warming lies which its defenders have been posting here for years has been deep into the scam of misinforming the public.

However, the differences between the two theories are much, much more fundamental than just the wording.  Perhaps the most obvious difference is that creationism is a committed structure of theological beliefs, while ID is based entirely on scientific evidence. Although it is true that ID has theological implications, the same could be said of evolution, the big bang, and, for that matter, any theory regarding the origin of biology and the universe. Creationism, on the other hand, is an entirely theological idea that attempts to find support in the realm of science.  Because it is theologically based, each of the following beliefs are necessarily a part of being a traditional creationist:  1. Apes and humans did not share a common ancestor.  2. The earth is about six thousand years old.  3. Life on earth did not have a common ancestor.  4. Changes within existing life occur only within fixed limits.  5. Belief in catastrophism, usually involving a global flood as the primary explanation.  6. There was a sudden creation of the universe, life, and energy from nothing.  None of the above beliefs are part of ID theory. Because ID is derived and proven using scientific evidence, it is a much more unassuming theory. ID proposes the following:  1. Irreducible and specified complexity are reliable indicators of design.   2. Systems in biology exhibit irreducible and specified complexity.   3. Natural and/or undirected explanations are inadequate when it comes to irreducible and specified complexity.   4.

The process involves a lot of zygotes being created, many of which will be unviable and a lot may have been able to develop properly but seeing as usually only one will implant they end up wasted.

An estimated 100 million Chinese citizens killed.  20 million Africans killed in various countries in Africa.  2 million Cambodians slaughtered.  This is just the first 5 off the top of my head that occured in the world during the 20th Century. All occured after sweeping gun control took place and forced disarmament of citizens.  In America, every state that has enacted restrictive gun control has seen an increase in crime, police brutality, questionable law enforcement practices such as violations of 4th amendment rights and so on. Washington DC enacted a total handgun ban in 1976, if you look at the crime rate reports from the years before and the years after that took effect, the truth is very telling.   In Britain and Australia, both nations enacted sweeping gun bans and forced confiscation. The crime rates of both nations has skyrocketed. Violent crime has especially increased in both countries as criminals realize they have little to fear from their victims now. Reports of police brutality in both nations is on the rise.   A consequence of the gun ban in Britain is the repeal of their guarantee of a quick and fair trial. This bit of legislation basically allows a suspect to be held indefinitely without a trial or even being notified of the crimes he or she is accused of.   For a very telling reason against gun control, I recommend you watch the UN Gun Debate between Rebecca Peters and Wayne LaPierre. Then, examine the international poll results online from the debate.   Gun control kills. History has proven this over and over again. I know that some gun control advocates have the best of intentions at heart but what they fail to realize is that by opening that door, they allow those with less than the best intentions to take advantage of the situation. This is exactly what Hitler did in 1938. He took advantage of the 1935 gun control act of Germany. He used it to find his enemies and eliminate them.   Is over 150 million victims of gun control reason enough for you? It is for me.  Mike", "label": "fact"}

I recall reading in my college psychology textbooks that the concept labeled 'self-awareness' doesn't happen until many months after birth. At the end of the day, in order to answer the question, I think you'd need a pretty solid definition of self-awareness, and coming to agreement on what 'self-awareness' is or should be may not be an easy task.  In a strictly biological sense, there is no debate that the biological life of a mammal begins at the point of conception/fertilization. There is no reasonable dispute to this observed fact. Only when subjective terms such as 'self-awareness' and 'personhood,' etc. come into play can there be valid debates. Show me a biologist or embryologist who states that the biological development of a unique mammal does not begin at conception/fertilization, and I'll show you a semantics game. ;)   It is perfectly valid for someone to have the opinion that 'life' begins with recordable brain activity (as early as 40-days post-conception)... or 'self-awareness' or any other such concept, or when the entity would be 'viable' outside the womb. But there are varying levels of brain activity. There is no agreed upon definition of self-awareness. And viability is an ever-changing concept (a 12-week fetus was delivered recently in Minnesota, and as far as I know is still alive and doing well -- please feel free to update me if you have heard any other news).  If we look to biology to answer the question of when a unique entity begins its biological development that will not end until it 'dies,' then the answer is conception/fertilization.", "label": "fact"}

{"text": "I think the christians you describe do not disregard creation in Genesis per sae. They would agree absolutely with your 2 fundemental truths at the start of your post. However, they do not see it as a history as such, but more as an analogy to what happened. Some take it simply to say that God created the universe and put a soul in humans and find the detail of that (not the soul bit) in what we have discovered through science. Others would say it becomes \"historical\" at a certain point- Adam and Eve or maybe Noah. I don't think they are any less christian than those who choose to believe the story of creation literally, and it would surprise me to hear someone say that was the case.  I think it does pose some awkward questions to hold such a view though, and while I don't see all your 8 examples in your later post as being the ones I have heard, they are certainly of that nature.  Christianity has struggled with the logical conclusions of observation of the physical world for much time. Some of the examples from history are amusing today- the Omphilodian Heresy where the very discussion of whether Adam and Eve had navels was a heinous religous crime. The Heliocentricity debate where the Catholic Church eventually relented their scripture based denial of the earth orbiting the sun. And today the debate over the old earth and evolution.  This seems to arrive from the fact that the religon is so encompassing in its assertion of truth.

{"text": "I think his point is paulie, that if evolution is actually as evo defines it, as changes made by way of random mutations, then why doesn't life reflect those random mutations? For example, why haven't a large number of lower animals who live their lives being hunted by carnivores adapted eyes in the back of their heads as a needed early warning system to see their stalkers coming from behind them?  Especially in times of drought and famine when food is scarce? The environmental pressure exists at those times to justify such a change, yet from fish to birds to reptiles to mammals to even insects, most every creature in creation has 2 eyes, 1 mouth, 2 ears, (if they even have ears since some animals use vibration sensors to locate the movement of prey and predator.)   It makes sense that Eagles, Hawks and Falcons have only 2 eyes since they are apex predators which rule their skies. But they regularly swoop down on smaller birds and pluck them out of the sky for food for their young. So why haven't smaller birds found the need to evolve eyes in the back of their heads?   One reptile has a type of third eye, but it isn't for sight nor is it permanent. It is used to absorb vitamin D from the Sun for the first 6 months of life in order to help it grow into a healthy adult. Then it is covered by scales. Tuatara Fact Sheet But the question persists as to why it seemingly devolved the need for that third eye if it originally had 3 working eyes? I mean, it didn't simultaneously evolve a poison gland or some other form of defense to replace the need for it.  Now let's look at some insects which you will invariably mention as flaws in my argument. They too have extra eyes called ocelli, not working eyes mind you; and neither do they aid in sight but the ocelli are simple structures and are believed they only detect light levels and movement. Now why would evolution not give vulnerable flying insects perfect vision when they have allegedly had literally hundreds of millions of years and many reasons to evolve it? Are you aware that the visual acuity of insects is approximately 1% of that of humans? And we all know that humans don't have the best eye sight in the animal kingdom.

Keep in mind that I have pointed out scientifically documented realities about what exists within the animal kingdom, but what I will get back from you are what ifs and maybes regarding these inconsistencies. Why is it that you never look at what is evolutionary dogma and ask why if random mutation happens based on environmental, social and predatory pressures, hasn't it made more diverse selections where needed, as in a working third eye in the back of animals heads, rather than in all cases follow a proscribed formula which exists today, just as it existed in the oldest fossils ever collected?", "label": "fact"}

The Flat Earth News, at least back then, had a regular column, \"One Hundred Proofs Earth is Not a Globe.\"  (go to http://www.flat-earth.org/)  Other theories taught as science  phrenology  alchemy  evolution  eugenics  neptunism  Theories of the Aether Articles relating to the Emergence of Scientific Theories of the Cosmic Aether  (http://www.mountainman.com.au/aether.html)  What about 'metascience'?  http://www.calresco.org/lucas/science.htm  Or, sciences used to support political ends...  What about Marxist Science  http://www.marxists.org/archive/hald...philosophy.htm  or Chaos Theory and Marxism  http://www.marxist.com/science/chaostheory.html  There's Nazi Science  http://www.webster.edu/~woolflm/naziscience.html  Nationalist Science  http://www.ljudmila.org/nettime/zkp4/08.htm  Or social ends...

What is wrong with assuming that genes therefore do not control the body is the fact that the genes were the blueprint for the body. The genes decided the arrangement of cells, the number of fingers, etc.  The body, the cells, and the organelles within the cells are therefore strongly influenced by the DNA sequence.", "label": "fact"}

However, the Brady campaign either didn't know, or (more likely) ignored the fact that all must follow federal law. They said \"Aww, well they're repealing a local law that forbids children from owning guns!! emoticonXCry\" while they ignored the federal law that does that.", "label": "fact"}

{"text": "Where to start with this proposal? First such a plan could lead to DC style gun control where you could only own a handgun if it was registered with the city, and then they could immediately halt any and all registration at any time, creating a de facto ban.  Then there's the fact that supporters of gun control have argued that gun owners should be required to pay a fee for each gun they register, and that the registration process should be something that needs to be repeated every single year, and the fee paid every time as well.  Then there was the proposal over in Pennsylvania where an officer would be allowed to deny registration for any reason, meaning automatic forfeiture of your weapons due to the \"only registered guns are legal guns\" policy that certain people embrace like the holy scripture.  And then there's the fact that registration leads to confiscation. We've seen it happen as recently as 12 years ago, we know it's the outright truth. Not long after the New York spree killing, the newspaper covering the proposal of gun licenses needing to be renewed every five years explicitly stated that if the registration lapsed the guns would be confiscated.  And then there's the fact that registration databases are nothing more than money pits that serve no crime fighting benefits, Canada has stated such. Any attempt at a database is going to waste taxpayer money, take police off the streets, and require police to prosecute honest people for paperwork errors rather than going after gang members and other criminals.  Oh and then we come to the fact that criminals will never register their weapons, leaving them untraceable!", "label": "fact"}
{"text": "That is an erroneous line of reasoning because it fails to take into account the myriad of other options open to a women after birth to remove the newborn from her care without any ill effects (physically anyway). Killing in the instance of a newborn is not justified because of those other options open to her. By contrast, a pregnant woman has exactly one option open to her to remove the fetus from her care and that is abortion. I would contend that the same line of reasoning that allows for adoption can be used here, that no one must donate their resources to a dependant.  Your reasoning that a woman, using the same line of reasoning that pro-choice people employ, can withhold her bodily resources \"until the newborn dies\" as if that is equal to withholding bodily resources in pregnancy is faulty.", "label": "fact"}

{"text": "I seem to take a different approach to this objection than most people. The principle of NS is so painfully obvious that I have trouble understanding why people have trouble understanding it. For this reason, I can see how it does sometimes come across as tautologous. Two plus two may be four because we've defined two and four that way, but that doesn't make the equation untrue. Likewise, that those genes that help animals be better able to pass on their genes will be passed on more often (due to whatever specifics) is true regardless of objection. Whatever works, works. Those mosquitoes that aren't drawn to the zapper live; those that are die. Those animals that can withstand the frigid winter live; those that can't freeze. Why is this so hard to understand?
