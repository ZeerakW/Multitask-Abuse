However, there is a variety of lung morphologies found in reptiles, including simple sacs in some lizards to the partitioned chambers with intricate support structures in organisms such as monitor lizards and crocodilians. And I am sure that peddler is aware that the crocodilians are the closest living relatives of birds, having arisen from an ancestral archosaur. The dinosaurs, through the ornithodirans, also arose from archosaurs. So the more advanced lung structure may have been ancestral since lizards arose from ancestral diapsids which also gave rise to the archosaurs.  So some birds have a system of (usually) 9 flexible air sacs that that act as bellows to move air through the lungs. Although the air sacs are not directly involved in respiration, they do have other functions, such as thermoregulation and weight reduction. Extensions of these air sacs have invaded the skeleton and form what are called pneumatic bones in birds.  However, there is considerable evidence that this condition occurred in organisms ancestral to birds first. Thus, in the maniraptoriformes it may have been useful in weight reduction in running predators and was retained in birds because the weight reduction was also useful for flight.  But some birds, current and fossil, do not have pneumatic bones. For example, Hesperonis lacked them for obvious reasons. But of course, Hesperonis lacked wings useful for flight.

{"text": "Radiocarbon is nevr used for 'millions of years'. It's used to measure human developments.  I suggest you read this.  Radiometric dating--the process of determining the age of rocks from the decay of their radioactive elements--has been in widespread use for over half a century. There are over forty such techniques, each using a different radioactive element or a different way of measuring them. It has become increasingly clear that these radiometric dating techniques agree with each other and as a whole, present a coherent picture in which the Earth was created a very long time ago. Further evidence comes from the complete agreement between radiometric dates and other dating methods such as counting tree rings or glacier ice core layers. Many Christians have been led to distrust radiometric dating and are completely unaware of the great number of laboratory measurements that have shown these methods to be consistent. Many are also unaware that Bible-believing Christians are among those actively involved in radiometric dating.  This paper describes in relatively simple terms how a number of the dating techniques work, how accurately the half-lives of the radioactive elements and the rock dates themselves are known, and how dates are checked with one another. In the process the paper refutes a number of misconceptions prevalent among Christians today. This paper is available on the web via the American Scientific Affiliation and related sites to promote greater understanding and wisdom on this issue, particularly within the Christian community.", "label": "fact"}

The Army identified the suspected gunman as Maj. Malik Nadal Hasan. A local radio reporter said Hasan is a Muslim convert.  Retired Maj. Gen. Robert Scales told Fox News the massacre did not appear to be the act of a mentally ill or extremely stressed person.   This was a deliberate act of execution,  he said.  The shooter was immediately killed, according to Lt. Gen. Bob Cone, a base spokesman, and two additional suspects, also soldiers, have been apprehended.  One incident, at about 1:30 p.m. Central Time, took place at a medical processing center, a second took place at a theater on the base, Lt Col Nathan Banks at the Pentagon told the Associated Press.  The base, about 60 miles from Austin, and two area school districts are on lockdown.  Greg Schannep, an aide to U.S. Rep. John Carter, said he was on the Army post to attend a graduation service, the Austin American-Statesman newspaper reported. As he neared the entrance of a building where the service was being held, he said, a soldier with blood on his uniform ran past him and said a man was shooting.  Schannep told the paper the shootings appeared to have occurred in a complex near the theater where the service was scheduled.  CNN reported President Obama has been advised of the shooting. White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said the president is being kept updated. CNN said staffers have gathered in the situation room, possibly as a precautionary measure since details are still emerging.  The FBI reportedly was en route.  Sgt. Major Jamie Posten of the Fort Hood public affairs office said shooting took place  near the soldier readiness processing center, where soldiers cycle through as they prepare to deploy.   Posten said soldiers go to the center up to 60 days before deployment to begin the process of vaccinations and other preparation.   It's still developing.

{"text": "I find the neo-marxist approach to political science interesting and useful. Largely because it accuratly describes and accounts for certain important underlying structures of our contemporary world. It is also flecxible enough to apply to more than just issues concerning economic classes.  I find marxist approach to economics interesting from a historic point of view, but not that useful. Basicly that is because many of the assumptions and predictions marxism made has since been falsefied and I have yet to see any rendition of the theories of old into anything useful.  I find Communism, as a state-less utopia based on solidarity and community, void of property ownership and class conflict a beutiful idea. But I don`t think it can be achieved through pursuing the socialistic state of pure governmental ownership of the means of production. In fact, I`m quite sceptic that it ever can be achieved (regardless of how you pursue it)  I find the stalinist and maoist attempts to interpret marxism and apply it to the real world one of the largest attrocities commited throughout modern history. Not only to the hundreds of thousands in the Gulabs and chinese prisons or the millions of victims of starvation or political violence, but also to all of those who actually believed in the proletarian revulotion and where sourly dissapointed when they found themselves slavering in the iron-mines i Kaukasus or working in the rice-fields with a gun-barrel as the only motivation for working harder.  I find Socialism, as a practice of democratic ownership of means of production and re-distribution of resources from the more productive or wealthy to the less productive and poor as a good tool to build a succesful society. But as with any tool, it shouldn`t be used in every situation, but only when and where appropriate. When using the tool of socialism, you are most often distorting the effects of the other tools of market forces. This needs to be considered as the market forces have one important attribute, efficiency.  There`s a summarise of my oppinions and reasons for having them.

Conclusions are drawn and explanations for phenomena are offered.

Well, yeah, if science hasn't provided an explanation for a phenomenon, then all we can do is shrug and submit grant proposals.  Yes, of course the past can never be proven.  But there are indirect ways to determine what happened within a reasonable ball park.  We can assume that our solar system formed merely by matter coalescing by gravity and then behaving the way matter behaves when it's all clumped together by gravity. We can model it on a computer and if we get something that looks like our current solar system then we can say that the model is a good one and the chances that the solar system formed that way are increased. No, sorry, there is no proof, only explanations and models.  * - edit: you know, actually, evidence in the form of experimental results are reviewed, or at least the methods are reviewed, and then if the experiment isn't reproducible then the evidence becomes suspect, so in that light evidence is, sort of, reviewed.

The main difficulty is the apparently loose relationship between morphological characters and their genetic basis.

University of California, Irvine, USA.  It has been proposed that modern humans descended from a single woman, the  mitochondrial Eve  who lived in Africa 100,000 to 200,000 years ago. The human immune system DRB1 genes are extremely polymorphic, with gene lineages that coalesce into an ancestor who lived around 60 million years ago, a time before the divergence of the apes from the Old World monkeys. The theory of gene coalescence suggests that, throughout the last 60 million years, human ancestral populations had an effective size of 100,000 individuals or greater.

{"text": "Fascinating - you blew right through your own usual misunderstandings of Darwinism and Darwinists and ended up with a sentence that is actually meaningful.  HGT (along with genetic drift) are important parts of modern evolutionary theory, but they do indeed have nothing to do with darwinian evolution sensu stricto, which does indeed insist on natural selection. This is why evolutionary biologists object to being called Darwinists in the sense that you and WW usually try to impose on us, and it is why we insist that there is more to evolution than natural selection or RM&amp;NS alone, and it is why we talk about the Neodarwinian Synthesis and Modern Evolutionary Theory. HGT validates the modern ToE. Modern evolutionary theory incorporates Darwin's version, and lot's more. HGT is part of the  lots more .  Some versions of lateral gene transfer have been accepted and studied for many decades, notably versions of conjugation in bacteria. (It wasn't until biologists were able to start sequencing DNA in quantity that we were able to see all the retroviral DNA segments and so forth.)  When someone like Gould (for example) talks about Darwinian evolution, depending on context, they are talking about either 1) the historical early version of the ToE as Darwin envisaged it, 2) the position that natural selection is the dominant process in evolution, or 3) an instance of evolutionary change in which natural selection is inferred to have been by far the most significant process. Evolution has moved well beyond Darwin's initial ideas to include mutations, recombination, and genetic drift, including HGT, in all sorts of combinations with each other and with natural selection.  As Chemist says, once HGT has occurred, the new version with the new genes can easily find itself competing with the old version, providing another way that NS can be involved, but it doesn't have to be. NS is just not all there is to evolution.  I can't wait to see how you are going to misinterpret this next.", "label": "fact"}

One believes established historical facts as a background for research, not as an answer box for the daily questions that arrive during our trek into the past.  Strict Creationists came to the conclusion that the Bible was literally true before they were presented with the evidence that it cannot be so.  Entirely not so. The evidence supporting Creationism is the Bible, written by man, bought and sold in many languages all over the world. The evidence supporting evolution is piled up in museums and institutional collections all over the world. The only evidence that the Creationists are right is that someone said so and we wrote it down. The evidence of evolution is here to touch, study, age-date and ponder. The 6000 year old earth story has been debunked.  Maybe that's your biggest problem, thinking that they're totally opposite.

{"text": "Capital Punishment and Deterrence: Examining the Effect of Executions on Murder in Texas. Authors John Sorenson, Robert Wrinkle, Victoria Brewer, and James Marquart examined executions in Texas between 1984 and 1997. They speculated that if a deterrent effect were to exist, it would be found in Texas because of the high number of death sentences and executions within the state. Using patterns in executions across the study period and the relatively steady rate of murders in Texas, the authors found no evidence of a deterrent effect. The study concluded that the number of executions was unrelated to murder rates in general, and that the number of executions was unrelated to felony rates. (45 Crime and Delinquency 481-93 (1999)).  Deterrence, Brutalization, and the Death Penalty: Another Examination of Oklahoma\u00c3\u0083\u00e2\u0080\u00a2s Return to Capital Punishment. In this study, author William Bailey speculated that if executions had a deterrent effect in Oklahoma, it would be observable by comparing murder rates and rates of sub-types of murder, such as felony-murder, stranger robbery-related killings, stranger non-felony murder, and argument-related killings, before and after the resumption of executions. Bailey examined the period between 1989 and 1991 for total killings and sub-types of killing. After controlling for a number of variables, Bailey found that there was no evidence for a deterrent effect. He did, however, find that there was a significant increase in stranger killings and non-felony stranger killings after Oklahoma resumed executions after a 25-year moratorium.

Basicly that is because many of the assumptions and predictions marxism made has since been falsefied and I have yet to see any rendition of the theories of old into anything useful.  I find Communism, as a state-less utopia based on solidarity and community, void of property ownership and class conflict a beutiful idea. But I don`t think it can be achieved through pursuing the socialistic state of pure governmental ownership of the means of production. In fact, I`m quite sceptic that it ever can be achieved (regardless of how you pursue it)  I find the stalinist and maoist attempts to interpret marxism and apply it to the real world one of the largest attrocities commited throughout modern history. Not only to the hundreds of thousands in the Gulabs and chinese prisons or the millions of victims of starvation or political violence, but also to all of those who actually believed in the proletarian revulotion and where sourly dissapointed when they found themselves slavering in the iron-mines i Kaukasus or working in the rice-fields with a gun-barrel as the only motivation for working harder.  I find Socialism, as a practice of democratic ownership of means of production and re-distribution of resources from the more productive or wealthy to the less productive and poor as a good tool to build a succesful society. But as with any tool, it shouldn`t be used in every situation, but only when and where appropriate. When using the tool of socialism, you are most often distorting the effects of the other tools of market forces.

Panderichthyes -> Tiktaalik -> Elginerpeton -> Ventastega -> Metaxygnathus -> Acanthostega -> Ichthyostega  Of course I do not mean to imply that any of these is ancestral to any other. Venastega, for example, is more primative in form that Acanthostega, and something like Venastega would be expected in the transitional sequence. However, it was almost contemproaneous with Acanthostega.  And I'm not sure where to put Pederpes finneyae. It is apparently not as old as Tiktaalik. It would also date to the same period between Panderichthys and Acanthostega known as Romer's Gap.  Per Ahlberg posted a  hint  about Tiktaalik on the IIDB evolution board on March 30.

Then came Einstein's Theory of General Relativity (which is fascinating in discovering that space and time are one thing), and the Big Bang Theory which developed on top of that. There are problems with General Relativity, which breaks down the closer the model gets to the actual moments of the beginning of the universe.  I'm going to say it again: the model isn't wrong, its incomplete. Models get replaced by better models that better fit our observations.

(Cook, Philip J., 'Robbery Violence,' Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology, 78-2, (1987):357-376.) For assaults, a crime which includes threats, the most widely cited estimate of the fatality rate is derived from a 1968 analysis of assaults and homicides committed in Chicago. The study, prepared for the National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence, reported that gun attacks kill 12.2 percent of their intended victims.

They're just like butterflies:  http://unisci.com/stories/20021/0313021.htm  Monteiro noted that the differences in wing patterns differentiate one species of butterfly from another and are used by males and females to determine with which individuals to mate.  They also have been shown to serve an adaptive purpose, as demonstrated by numerous studies focusing on seasonal changes in wing coloration of individuals in a species.  For instance, Monteiro said, the darker wing patterns that show up in butterflies that emerge in the spring serve to warm up the butterfly faster, whereas butterflies that emerge in the summer have lighter colors.   Also, many butterflies that emerge in the wet season in the tropics have large, conspicuous marks on their wings that deflect the attacks of predators while the butterflies are actively finding mates and laying eggs, while the dry-season cohorts are very cryptic, trying to blend in with their environment and not attract any attention from predators until the rains arrive again,  she said.  The authors note that what's not known about wing patterns in butterflies are the genetic mechanisms that result in the great variety of patterns that exist and an understanding of how those mechanisms have evolved through time.  ------------------------------  The pepprered moth story is the biggest myth of all time. moths emerge physiologically according to background, predators and other external conditions:  http://ourfcs.friendscentral.org/mot...yphenism1.html  Many species of moths and butterflies are known to exhibit a seasonal polymorphism, where one form predominates at one time of year and an alternative form occurs in a different season. Some species also show differences in adult size between two seasonal forms. In some cases, the change in seasonal markings has been shown to correlate with temperature; in these instances it is believed that one color form can provide more rapid or effective solar heating through a larger proportion of darker patterns. In other cases, the seasonal forms are believed to be connected to a more effective cryptic ability according to the nature of available background surfaces.", "label": "fact"}

{"text": "Actually its one of the oldest gun laws on the books.  The Sullivan Act, also known as the Sullivan Law, is a controversial gun control law in New York State. Upon first passage, the Sullivan Act required licenses for New Yorkers to possess firearms small enough to be concealed. Possession of such firearms without a license was a misdemeanor, carrying them was a felony. The possession or carrying of weapons such as brass knuckles, sandbags, blackjacks, bludgeons or bombs was a felony, as was possessing or carrying a dagger,  dangerous knife  or razor  with intent to use the same unlawfully . Named for its primary legislative sponsor, state senator Timothy Sullivan, a notoriously corrupt Tammany Hall politician, it dates to 1911, and is still in force, making it one of the older existing gun control laws in the United States.  Many believe the act was to discriminate against immigrants in New York, particularly Italians, as the first person arrested under the law was mobster Giuseppe Costabile. Whether this was part of the law's intent, it was passed on a wave of anti-immigrant rhetoric as a measure to disarm an alleged criminal element. The police granted the licenses, and could easily discriminate against  undesirable  elements. Sponsor  Big Tim  Sullivan reputedly desired the law so that his criminal cohorts could go about their activities unimpeded by citizens defending themselves with concealed handguns. It was used against political enemies by dropping a small pistol into an overcoat pocket. Thus having them arrested and put in jail for violation. Big Tim stepped in front of a speeding subway train.", "label": "fact"}

Guns make it easier to kill people. Do you think you have a greater chance of escaping with your life from a criminal that is armed with a knife or a gun?   From Dr. Roth's study: The overall fatality rate in gun robberies is an estimated 4 per 1,000--about 3 times the rate for knife robberies, 10 times the rate for robberies with other weapons, and 20 times the rate for robberies by unarmed offenders. (Cook, Philip J., 'Robbery Violence,' Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology, 78-2, (1987):357-376.) For assaults, a crime which includes threats, the most widely cited estimate of the fatality rate is derived from a 1968 analysis of assaults and homicides committed in Chicago. The study, prepared for the National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence, reported that gun attacks kill 12.2 percent of their intended victims. This is about 5 times as often as in attacks with knives, the second most deadly weapon used in violent crimes.   http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~zj5j-gttl/guns.htm  Some facts you may find interesting:   Crime in England and Wales remains stable and the chances of being a victim of crime are still the lowest in more than twenty years, according to the first quarterly crime update published today by the Home Office.....

(The Kinsey Institute New Report on Sex (1991) puts the percentage even higher.)  I think it's logical to assume that the overwhelming majority of these women were neither lesbians nor performing the act by themselves, but with male partners. The figure can therefore safely be extended to the population at large, give or take a few percentage points.  Given that most conservative estimates place the entire gay population of the U.S. at 3-5% (some ultra-right groups place it even lower), taken with the uncontestable facts that 1) few lesbians indulge in penetrative anal sex, and 2) a significant portion of gay men don't either, it becomes clear that, in raw numbers, the number of heterosexuals who are having anal sex far surpasses the number of gay people doing the same.", "label": "fact"}

A true theory would be a replacement not an alternative.  The Wrong Answer Will Always Be The Wrong Answer!  If evolution was true there would be overwhelming , uncontestable evidence, there is no uncontestable evidence. Little that is any more than pure imagination.  Theories start out as hypothesis and are then subject to experimentation and observation. When they fail they are discarded. For instance spontaneous generation was disproved by Pasteur and discarded as a theory.  Evolution which is not a theory ,although it is called one ,has been falsified nine ways to Sunday. Two of Darwin's own falsifications have come to pass and ignored. The Galopagos Finches have proven to interbreed which destoys a great deal of the so called basis of his theory.  Extinct  animals and plants are found alive and ignored as evidence against evolution. Theories are made to be challenged but evidence against evolution is suppressed.  Evolutionist had to revive spontaneous generation although it is scientifically impossible because without it atheism is impossible. The atheist must have a story no matter how bizzare to justify his faith . Science suffers because of this.  My theory is that this planet is exactly what Einstein said it was , a place designed by a Supreme Being to be inhabited by people.  The evidence is creation itself. If there is a creation there must be a Creator.  Nothing has ever been observed to self assemble and there is no known process that could accomplish that.  Animals and plants just like the ones alive today have always existed. Many have gone extinct but death is not evidence of evolution.  Human beings are incapable of creating a grain of sand from nothing.  There are grains of sand so there is an intelligence greator than ours that did.  The perfect balance seen in the anthropic principle tells of a Creator.  The unbelievable complexity of the human body makes evolution impossible.  DNA can not exist without proteins. Proteins are coded by the information in the DNA molecule. They had to come into being simultaneously.  Pre-biotic natural selection is impossible , there is no process to affect the evolution of DNA outside of a living organism.

Countering their contributions were Dawkins, Attenborough and Miller. Dawkins was typically dismissive of the validity of ID and to the point about the intelletual dangers it poses, Miller countered the arguements of irreduable complexity and the alleged mathematical improbability of evolution and Attenborough made some more reservedl but no less powerful observations on the true nature of the fundementalists agenda.  This was against the backdrop of material on the Dover trial and some stuff on the Vatican's outlook on ID.

In fact, by your approach we still would have had illegal interracial marriage into the late 80's, early 90's.

{"text": "In 1993 a Swiss professor, Martin Killias, published a study of 18 countries concerning gun ownership, homicide and suicide. He in part concluded there was a weak correlation between total homicide and gun ownership. For a partial criticism of his study see Dunblane Misled where using the countries studied by Killias, these researchers found a much stronger correlation between firearm homicides and car ownership. More seriously, when the United States was included in the Killias study, a stronger correlation between total homicide and gun ownership was found. When two countries were excluded, the U.S. (high gun ownership, high murder rate) and Northern Ireland (low gun ownership, high murder rate) the correlation was marginally significant. Gary Kleck writes,  Contrary to his claim that 'the overall correlation is not contingent upon a few countries with extreme scores on the dependent and independent variable', reanalysis of the data reveals that if one excludes only the United States from the sample there is no significant association between gun ownership and the total homicide rate.  (Kleck, Targeting Guns: Firearms and Their Control, p 253. Walter de Gruyter, Inc. New York, 1997.) Kleck concludes that  the homicide-guns study was not international at all, but merely reflected the unique status of the United States as a high-gun ownership/high-violence nation...Since the positive association Killias observed was entirely dependent on the U.S. case, where self-defense is a common reason for gun ownership, this supports the conclusion that the association was attributable to the impact of the homicide rates on gun levels.", "label": "fact"}

Tiktaalik was expected to live in a certain type of environment, and this expectation was used to further narrow the localities that would be explored as potential deposits for containing the expected  transitional  form.  3. Having selected the locality, expeditions were mounted and successfully recovered remains of the anticipated beastie. Upon analysis it was found to lie in terms of evolutionary development between the most derived/advanced fish and most primitive tetrapods that had been previously known.  Given the huge expanse of the Earth's surface 1 and 2 helped the researchers select comparitively tiny areas to examine and the fact they found what they (roughly) expected to find says their hypothesis (we will find remains of transitional form x at locality y) was borne out. If no remains had been found then further expeditions might have been successful and the hypothesis could of been validiated at a later date. If they had found, lets say a more primitive form than the previously most advanced fish or a more advanced tetrapod than the previously most primitive form then I think that might amount to a falsifiaction.  Having said all that I think that to claim a hypothesis was validated in this instance is slightly confusing as palaeontology is like archeology- you can never be 100% sure everthing has been found and one small discovery can force a rethink of what that had been established up to that point. Also, IIRC, none of the three articles in nature make any reference to a hypothesis being validated  I'd describe it more as being an expectation being fufilled.", "label": "fact"}

{"text": "I've examined Hall's papers and they make interesting reading. However, further research, including some undertaken by Hall himself, has informed the debate greatly.  For one thing, many of the experimental results to which Hall originally proposed sub-population hypermutation (your 'hypermutation as a eusocial response') as an explanation have proved inconsistent with that hypothesis. The Amplification Mutation model described above is a much better fit, correctly predicting such details as clonally-related bacteria possessing redundant lac- copies in addition to the lac+ revertant. The articles I've already cited, though they focus on the Cairns system's experimental vulnerabilities as the origin of the recent directed/adaptive mutagenesis misperception, also include Hall's work in their assessment.  Hall himself performed a followup experiment to his work on anomalous rates of trpAB+ dual revertants, acknowledging that a colleague's suggestion, that stochastically-occurring trpA+trpB revertants were growing on waste byproducts secreted by non-growing trpAtrpB+ revertants was probably correct.  In short, though hypermutation of a sub-population does occur sometimes, it is not always an organismic response (eg mutation promoters coincidentally amplified along with useful genes), and the 'successful' mutants do not always, or even mostly, arise from within that subpopulation.  Also, you still seem reluctant to acknowledge the implications of the existence of a physical mechanism for hypermutation under stress. It must itself have evolved somehow - which makes it logically (as well as empirically, as evidenced by my original post in which 4/5ths of the adaptive bacteria exhibited no increased mutation rate) not a prerequisite for evolution.

{"text": "And in Daphnia you might want to consder that the specifics are known to some degree as to what compound serves as a signal of predators.  http://plankt.oxfordjournals.org/cgi...tract/fbi142v1  Just in case you are too lazy to read here is a bit of the article.  Daphnia may respond with an array of antipredator defences (behavioral, morphological, life-history) to a chemical cue (kairomone) exuded by its predators: fish and Chaoborus. Given the wide array of potential responses, it is an interesting question whether antipredator defences are coupled or independent of each other. Since antipredator responses are costly and even possessing the genetic information to respond to a certain predator might involve a cost, clones may only react to predators they co-occur with in nature. In this study we provide evidence for an uncoupling of responses by Daphnia pulex in several antipredator defences against Chaoborus. We were unable to detect a correlation between behavioral (migration), morphological (neck-spine induction), and life-history (growth rate, neonate size and size at first reproduction) responses. Furthermore, antipredator responses did not always comply with what is commonly believed. We found that Daphnia clones can migrate up or down when exposed to fish or Chaoborus kairomone, and that population growth rate, neonate size and size at first reproduction can increase or decrease in response to Chaoborus kairomone. We also show patterns in antipredator defences that seem to relate to the habitat from which clones were derived. Daphnia clones that were collected in habitats with Chaoborus as the dominant predator tended to react strongly to Chaoborus kairomone by migrating upward and producing neckspines. The migration behaviour against fish kairomone in these clones was often an unexpected upward migration. The Daphnia clone that co-existed with fish predators showed a downward migration in the presence of fish as well as Chaoborus kairomone. Clones that had occurred with either both or no predators had mixed responses. We sometimes found an upward migration in combination with smaller body size as a response to Chaoborus kairomone. This may be interpreted as a behavioural defence against Chaoborus and a life-history defence against fish. Daphnia seem not to exhibit defence behaviour against predators they do not co-occur with. It might be costly for Daphnia to maintain genetic information to respond to these predators and protect that information from genetic drift.", "label": "fact"}

In some situations it still has a meaning that it had back in Victorian times. It meant change in a particular direction, as in stelar evolution - stars  evolve  in predictable ways. It also sometimes carries the connotation of progress. But none of these meanings are applicable to theories of biological evolution. There is no concept of purpose or direction to the word when used in a biological context.  Here is a more precise definition of evolution: evolution is a change in the heritable characteristics of a population of living organisms over generations. When scientist or a knowledgable amateur speaks of the  theory of evolution,  it is this theory that is being discussed. Unmodified, the term has come to mean biological evolution. Those who include the big bang (cosmological evolution) or the formation, life and death of stars (stelar evolution) are either ignorant or dishonest. Even the question of the origin of life is irrelevant. One may postulate a magical, all powerful being that created the first life. The theories of evolution attempt to explain how life changes and has changed over time.", "label": "fact"}

The decision by the outspoken prelate, reported on The Providence Journal's Web site, significantly escalates a bitter dispute between Tobin, an ultra orthodox bishop, and Kennedy, a son of the nation's most famous Roman Catholic family.   The bishop instructed me not to take Communion and said that he has instructed the diocesan priests not to give me Communion,  Kennedy told the paper in an interview conducted Friday.  Kennedy said the bishop had explained the penalty by telling him  that I am not a good practicing Catholic because of the positions that I've taken as a public official,  particularly on abortion.

Mayor Adrian Fenty has promised to sign the bill, which was co-sponsored by 10 of the council's 13 members. The final vote Tuesday was 11-2.  The bill now goes to Congress, which has final say over the district's laws. Opponents say they'll try to get Congress or voters to overturn it.  Passage of the bill is a victory for gay marriage supporters, who have been dealt a recent string of defeats in Maine, New York and New Jersey.  Gay marriage is legal in Massachusetts, Connecticut, Iowa and Vermont. New Hampshire will begin issuing licenses in January.  If Congress doesn't reject the bill, D.C. should start issuing marriage licenses around St. Patrick's Day.The Associated Press: DC City Council votes to legalize gay marriage", "label": "feel"}

{"text": "As firearms sales in the United States hit new highs, the Obama Administration and Democrats in Congress are squelching talk of a renewal of the assault weapons ban passed by Congress that lapsed in 2004, saying they don't want a distraction from their agenda and don't have the votes in Congress.  Seven million people have applied for criminal background checks since November in an effort to buy guns, according to the FBI. That figure doesn't include Virginia, whose gun shows don't require any background checks.  The buying bonanza has stripped some stores almost bare of assault weapons and yielded a national ammunition shortage.  As gun sales blossom, Democrats' interest in regulating gun sales appear to be waning, despite the recent spate of high-profile gun violence.  Two recent reports have fingered the Obama Administration and the assault weapons ban's most ardent supporter in Congress -- Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) -- as putting off any effort to regulate high-powered weapons. Congressional officials told a reporter in comments published Saturday that Obama and top White House aides have all but abandoned a push for tighter gun control, indicating they can't stomach a fight with the National Rifle Association when they're focused on other issues.   He and other White House strategists have decided they can't afford to tangle with the National Rifle Association at a time when they're pushing other priorities, like economic renewal and health-care reform,  congressional officials said.

Anti-abortion legislation is simply a tool by which they try to maintain a less sexually permissive society, believing that if women who fall pregnant outside of marriage are forced to endure pregnancy and likely child-raising alone, rather than being offered an easy way out, they will be less likely to have sex outside of marriage.  For this reason any method of contraception poses the same threat to them as abortion does, though some methods may be easier to rally support against than others.", "label": "feel"}

Marriage also consists of a nifty little tax break. I'm sorry, but I don't want to pay for that. I think the initial break was there to help raise a family. Until homosexual couples can have children, I don't want to fork that out of my paycheck.  They can legalize these marriages for all I care, but I'm not paying for them, and I'm sure other's don't want to either.  Also, homosexual has all of a sudden started to grow at an alarming rate. It's more than it used to be, and I don't think genetics have anything to do with it. It's learned. So if we keep teaching everyone that it's fine, then sure, we'll have more homosexuals. That's beside the point though.  Why are we all of a sudden questioning the definition of marriage? 50 years ago, no one would have thought otherwise. Man and Woman.

For example, I was called a hypocrite because I'm prochoice and pregnant.

I know all the Creationist arguments, I have used them. And I used to be a darn good creationist debater...I could almost convince atheists who just didn't understand enough science to refute me. I had learned evolution in high school. I could repeat the facts, but I didn't believe them. I never argued with high school biology teachers becasue they didn't know enough about it to argue back. Then cam college. I took a course in evolution, because I am a curious and open-minded person. I went to class I took the notes and I talked to my prof. during his office hours. For each of the proofs he gave me, I gave him reasons (creationist arguments) that they weren't proof or that they were wrong, and he was able to easily refute any argument I gave him. I always questioned him and refuted things in the book, but he always refuted mine right back, and he did a better job and used undeniable empirical evidence. (No I am not going to give you any here I have neither the time nor the degree) At this point I was a very confused Christian, I talked to other Christians, I found sites online and then I found a creationist debate site. I asked what they thought and after hearing points from all sides: atheist, hard-core creationist, theistic evolution, self-righteous butt heads. I came to my own conclusion with all the facts that I had. Since then I have seen Kent Hovind speak...and I uh...won't go there. The fact of the matter is...can my belief in an old evolved earth withstand creationist arguments...I would say so. Have I taken classes in Creation...heck yeah. Will I take more in the future...sure if I think they have anything to add to my knowledge. In fact there is a professor at my college who is a creationist and if he ever speaks I will certainly go to hear him. So am I close minded or afraid to learn something new or change my opinion...no. I look to find the truth through facts and knowledge. Because after all when you find truth you find God. So instead of attempting to turn my question back to me, why don't you actually ask yourself...are you afraid to take a detailed class in evolution taught by someone with a PhD...could Creationism stand up to it. I can't answer that question for you, and I can't even tell you whether you should try to find the answer or not, it's your choice.

Next, one may reasonably consider that children are cognitively different from adults. Despite what society or 5 judges have to say, that seems to me a valid reason for applying different sentences to different people.  The question was raised with respect to the death penalty as well. We are not talking about criteria for guilt, but once convicted, we are talking about whether to execute a person or not. Unless you feel that punishment should be based solely on retribution, I think there is some wiggle room for different sentencing guidelines for different aged humans.   You have conceded that a difference in neurophysiologic fitness makes sense, but we should decide on a case by case basis. If you can figure out a reliable way to do that, go for it.   We draw the line based upon age all the time for all sorts of things.  The issue of abortion is different for many reasons. We are not deciding on whether to execute a person based upon a crime they committed. That makes it a different issue. Ideally, we would never have a pregnant young woman under the age of 18 make a decision like that without the support and guidance of her loving parents. The ideal situation sometimes does not exist. An underage female may legally make this decision precisely because there are many out there who do not have that guidance at all or informing parents would make things worse. It just so happens that females are fertile prior to 18, so we do not have the luxury of applying similar age requirements. If you could ban pregnancy prior to 18, now you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be talking.", "label": "feel"}

I have seen so many documents, on teens the are confused about their sexual orintation, because of living i the house with their gay parents. On girl wondered if she was gay because her mother was with another woman. She felt that was normal behavior. And started to concider being with girls herself. But was confused when she started to like men. She actually thought that liking men was abnormal. Until others told her it is normal to like men.  A boy had almost the same experience, he did not know if he too should like men, because his father did. Often he would fight back desires for females, because he thought he needed to be with men. Not only that by he was ridculed by classmates because of his father being gay.  Alot of children endure harassment because of living in a house made up of parents of the same sex. Just because it did not happen to your son, dose not mean that it dose not happen. And your experience is only a fraction of 1% of the experiences that children go through because of having gay parents. It is impossible to say that it dose not happen. If it dose not happen to a few, then thats fine. But the majority suffers, and that far outweighs the few that don't suffer because of having gay parents.", "label": "feel"}

Rational demonstration is useless when trying to show something without evidence or without rational demonstration, which is the case with your \"unknowable, self-contradictory\" idea of a god.  This is why you MUST believe through faith, which requires no rational demontration. It's no secret why faith needs no evidence, it CANNOT use evidence, it's the opposite of reason. Why do you think the term faith exists in the first place? Reason does fine with the rational world. You needed a word to fit the irrational. Otherwise, why would you need faith?

Since you missed it (It's only the first post in the thread)  For gay coupes right to be married (Or the same legal status)  1. Human rights with regards to legal classifcation and the benefits therein are desired by comitted consenting adults of the same gender.  2. It's a contract between two consenting adults.  3. A contract that does not violate anyone's legal rights or cause any significant ill effects to the public welfare.  It's unconstitutional to allow one group of people access to marriage rights (hetero couples only), and not allow it to female/female and male/male couples when they are obviously lobbying for it in significant numbers. It's now a public issue on a significant scale.  Of course, maybe if you had a REASON for objecting to gays being treated equally with regards to the rights of marriage, we would understand not only why you are reluctant to back your claim, but why your reason is also not constitutional.  You can call it games, I call it justifying my position while pointing out how opponents of gay rights, such as yourself, really can't make any reasonable justification for their desire to restrict human rights, other than saying \"well I want to\"...or in your case... \"shhh...it's a secret\".

{"text": "When contraception failed in my monogamous long term relationship, I heavily researched both options, as well as parenting. I looked into requirements for Medicaid, WIC, and other subsidized assistance offered in my community. I called a few clinics around town. That's an interesting story, but not for here.  I had heart to heart talks to many different people with different viewpoints.  I decided to have an abortion because I was sick all the time. I had diagnosed migraine headaches constantly, and my seizure disorder that had laid dormant for years returned. I couldn't leave my house. I lost my job. I was in the middle of my education (it was early summer) and if I continued my pregnancy it would have put me back a semester, thus costing thousands of dollars. The father did not want me to continue the pregnancy because he was concerned about my physical health.  Just thinking about that time period makes me nauseated.  I understood the merits of adoption, especially since my father was adopted. I talked to my aunt about adoption and foster care, since she has participated in both. I also thought about parenting, the love and all the things I have to offer. I knew that the father would have supported my decision to parent, I knew that our financial hardships could be dealt with, and I knew that my education could be continued later.  I came to the conclusion that abortion was the best choice for me and my health. I appreciate that some may find this decision selfish, and essentially it is, since it was made with my best interests in mind. I would also hope that even if they consider it selfish, they understand the reasons why I made that decision. And if it was your wife, daughter, friend, and she was dealing with what I was, you would not expect her to continue a pregnancy.", "label": "feel"}

I don't have to like the choices someone else makes, and I don't have to agree with it, but while I have that right, I also believe that people should have the right to make those decisions. Are these anti-abortion people going to step in and pay for the cost of having the baby, raising it, etc..??? Maybe some of those are the issues people consider when having an abortion. Maybe the woman was raped. I see the point when someone said that the baby should not be punished for that, and I agree with that, but the rape was committed against the woman's will... she didn't ask for that to happen, and if a pregnancy results from that, that is also against her will, so why should she feel that she has to have the child? What does she tell the child when it decides to ask who its father is?? The child could still be born and given up for adoption, and that is a good idea, but maybe the woman will relive the rape throughout the pregnancy by being reminded of it on a daily basis.... all I feel is until it happens to you, and YOU are forced to make these kinds of choices, you shouldn't judge anyone else for the choices that they make.", "label": "feel"}

However, as with any person God has defined himself. We all definie or identify, ourselves by various methods. What we like and dislike. What we do, where we go, where we have been. God has done this as well in the bible. He has mades statements about the things he likes and dislikes (The ten commandments for instance). He tells what he does (he is a creator for instance, He loves, he has mercy and grace.) He tells us where he has been (He is the God that is, was, and will be, in otherwords exists outside of time).  There are other things naturally. I can tell you some because as a finite being I will take a life time getting to know him. This is true with any person. You cannot completely define your closest and dearest friend. It is impossible because people are infinitely complex. You can know your friend none the less. This is true of God as well. You have heard me talk about God on this forum for quite sometime. This is how God is defined. You ask an impossibly broad question. Sglaine seems to imply that theists will only hamper you with illogic when it comes to defining God and they will eventually say they don't know. I know some not all. So do you. This is right.

I will bet that simone will choose to COMPLETELY IGNORE MY POST because I am removing all lines of dishonest \"logic switching\". (or, at least attempting to)  Rather than admit wrongness, (very hard to do once a person has so vehemently commited themselves to an agenda) there is no other choice than to follow the trail of that path to the end. Even if the path leads to a land of complete logical make believe and you are thereby forced to defend your chosen agenda even if it means temporarily making logical \"detours\".   After all, if objects have no inherent evil or goodness, it must be the character of the USER and the chosen purpose of the USER that determines the ethical value of how an item is used.  If this is so, you can't call guns bad. This determination can not be admitted on the path simone has chosen. Therefore, since simone's agenda insists on the inherent evilness of an object (a gun) there MUST be some logical deviation to explain why these \"evil\" items are not \"evil\" when used by police. If there is no logical deviation on a path that is in error, you will have no choice but to arrive in error's destination: make believe land! Where matches burn down houses! And knives cause slashings! And candle holders cause bashed in skulls!....AND......AND.....GUNS CAUSE SHOOTINGS!  Well, simone. We're down to brass tacks. Is a gun bad, or is it the determination of the person who uses it?  Because if a gun is bad, then we live in la-la land. And if a gun is an inanimate object who's user is responsible for how it is used, you have no argument for why law abiding people can't posess them and be capable of the determination (As police do) for using them in a responsible manner.

However, you believe others should have the right to drive drunk if they so choose. So, you are personally against drunk driving but you are \"pro-choice\" in that regard (meaning you believe every person should make that determination for themselves). Therefore there should be no laws preventing it and no punishment for the sad results.   Pro-life would be: You don't drive drunk (morally against it perhaps) and you are going to make sure no one else is able to either.", "label": "feel"}

That should not be your choice (this is another problem with humanism, because there is no moral authority to stop people from doing whatever they want to do, hence the adage that humanism is a philosophy that has both feet planted firmly in mid-air). I am sure the child wouldn't agree to that choice if given a voice to do so.   Let's go ahead and do it your way by taking religion out of law. Is murder still illegal in your humanistic world?

There is an infinite number of examples I could give to illustrate that point. Take in a sci-fi convention some time as a prime example.  3) I don't see so much the discussion of \"is there a God/isn't there a God\", as I do the discussion of religion and the Bible. That is a very important distinction. Religion is very real, and affects all of us, whether we are believers in it or not. Whether or not Bigfoot exists, or the Klingons are invading someone, has no bearing whatsoever on my life or reality, religion does. I think that is the reason you see such fervent discussion and rejection of Christianity on forums like this. Why the large outcry?

{"text": "When the founding fathers determined that religion should not be established, nor prohibited from being freely exercised, they probably wouldn't have considered atheism (the assertion that there is no God) to be a religion, because at the time it wasn't organized, or funded. The Judeo Christian religions were organized and funded at the time, as were other types of religion. They weren't concerned with what beliefs majorities or minorities had, they were concerned with impositions a religion could put on segments of the population with their organizational requirements, or money issues. They could see atheists needing protection from religion, but they couldn't see religion needing protection from atheism, because it wasn't organized. While it can be argued that atheism is not a religion, it can't be argued that it isn't an EQUIVALENT to religion today, with the organization and funding that it now has. 200 years ago, an organization needed buildings and meetings and transportation to be organized. With today's communications, it does not. Just type \"atheism\" in any search engine and note the organization, and political action.   I'm not using the term \"atheism\" in a derogatory manner. It's an assertion that there is no God. But today it's every bit as organized and politically active as any religion - it has happened practically overnight, thanks to modern communications. It now has the same ability to impose itself on society exactly like religion, and is covered by the first amendment the same as any religion. It cannot claim science as its god, and force it upon public education.  3) One of the most interesting things about this whole issue is the fact that the same thing, only reversed, was going on in the US 100 years ago.   http://www.campusmagazine.org/articl...2-2f7cc3afdb0f  The concept of evolution was recently founded at that time, and some closed minded religious people were afraid of it, and vehemently opposed having it taught in schools. Today, the concept of intelligent design, (void of any certain religion and its associated faith) is vehemently opposed by closed minded Darwinists, who are afraid of it in exactly the same way.  I suspect the same thing was at the root of it all 100 years ago just like today - concerns of how the money flows. Religious leaders seek funding - secular science seeks funding.   If I would have been alive 100 years ago, would I have opposed having evolution taught in schools? Of course I would have, because I wouldn't have been able to forsee how the benefits that the study of microevolution, genetics, and other non controversial aspects of evolution have benefited society. Chances are there are equal, undiscovered things about intelligent design that could be discovered it we would give it a chance.   In the words of biologist Arthur Jones;", "label": "feel"}

{"text": "The definition of manslaughter is when one's actions, which end up killing someone, display a reckless disregard for the dangers of the situation. That's not a proper legal definition, but it'll do.  Now, you want to argue that pro-lifers would be forced into the counterintuitive conclusion that ALL miscarriage is manslaughter, and thus their position is ridiculous. I'm saying that they would only be forced to admit that a very small portion of miscarriage is manslaughter, and a portion that they would probably be willing to make a case for.  I'm not saying \"miscarriage is not manslaughter,\" but only \"miscarriage is not always manslaughter.\" For example, if a woman took perfectly good care of herself and did nothing dangerous, but had a miscarriage anyway, she would obviously not have committed manslaughter. If a woman had one drink with dinner, but she was carrying a very unhealthy fetus and it died, then she would not have committed manslaughter, because that was not reckless. I pointed out the \"you-shouldn't-be-drinking-and-having-unprotected-sex\" argument as a position somebody might hold, but I think that it would probably be judged as unrepresentative of the definition of manslaughter.   So obviously, miscarriage cannot be manslaughter in the sense of \"every instance of A is an instance of B.\"", "label": "feel"}

My whole point is that we kill people every day whether you like it or not, so this whole right to life thing is nonsense. You may not be the one pulling the trigger, but you always contribute to deaths. But we try to select which deaths we cause so that those deaths will lead to the most happiness for everyone else. And I think that allowing abortion does lead to more happiness for society. And before you try to show me polls about abortion to prove that many people disagree with it, and so it causes them unhappiness, that's not the only thing I'm talking about. I'm talking about the unhappiness of the child born into an ungrateful family, the potential criminal problems, and all the other things that have already been mentioned.

By definition of reason, it is the intellectual faculaty by which conclusions are drawn from premises. On the existence of a rational Creator who made us in His image, our \"intellectual faculty\" would also be made in His image. Thus it is rational and logical. Hence, the conclusion that we come to from the premise that God exists is rational and logical. While evolution says we are accidents, and hence, our brain patterns that governs our logic and ability to reason must also be accidnets (i.e we would be irrational and illogical). After reasoning, the conclusions we came to would be most likely irrational and illogical.

{"text": "Just as you have a background in science Frog, I also have an extensive background in Christianity. A brief synopsis: starting at birth I was without consent given the supposed \"gift\" of Catholic faith. In highschool I met a kid and later on a girlfirend who were both Born Again Christians. I thought I'd dabble in it. The girlfirend and I went our seperate ways, but I remained a Christian and began studying the Bible. The transformations in me were mostly bad and far beyond the scope of this (we can discuss it on a different forum), but one important thing occured when I began studying the Bible in earnest. I found holes and flaws too big to be ignored. Don't ask me what they were because, again, this is not the religious forum and I'd be hard pressed to even tell you what they were, but I assure you there was a time I could quote them chapter and verse. Since that time I have tried my best to forget it. I realized that my error was the attempt to literally interpret the Bible. I knew that if I pulled back from that, attempting instead to decipher the good message of the scriptures, I could perhaps save my Christian faith. But I didn't want to become an apologist. So, in my mind I travelled east. I dabbled in Taoism and Buddhism which appealed very much to my love of Asian history. After a year or two of this, when I discovered there was also a strict theology behind these Asian religions, and it was not just a matter of reading Thomas Merton, meditating and burning incense, I realized that I had been acting like a rich divorced woman with much too much time on her hands (Think of the British sitcom \"Absolutely Fabulous\" --- greatest show of all time after Seinfeld), and that if you're really goign to commit yourself to something you need to do more than scratch the surface. It was then, when all religious answers seemed to elude me, that I subscribed to agnosticism: athiesm with a parachute as my old English professor used to say. And on that note I remain today. I don't know the answer and therefore will not comment. Through all of it, however, one philosophy has given me freedom: the beginning of wisdom can be found in the notion that we don't have the answers. Do you say I have the answers because men wrote them in a book nearly 2000 years ago, and I can take their word for it? Hell, Frog, I don't take the word of a man who writes the answers in a book today, let alone 2000 years ago. I open the newspaper always skeptical. If you tell me something, you'd better be able to support it.  Now what I do believe is an entire scientific community which can back up their claims, publish them and open up their work for anyone else in the world with the means to duplicate these tests (or subject a hypothesis to a different test of their own design).   The problem with the Bible is that its primary source of evidence is the Bible. A bad comparison, but a comparison nonetheless would be my writing a book and telling you that book is the truth because I say so. Exceprts from the Bible which may point to actual historical events or documented figures do not by rote prove that Jesus walked on water. I call Bible-thumpers mindless because this has been my experience, Frog. Up close and personal. They think inside the very tiny box of their scriptures and ask that we accept it by faith. But the basis by which we're really accepting it is widescale social acceptance. If enough people, enough books, enough teachers point to this single source and say \"it is truth,\" then the cud-chewing masses will usually fall in line. But that doesn't necessarily mean I am going to buy it. I would prefer listening to people, books and teachers who point to many different sources and say this is truth. If I want to see evidence of the Bible I can read the Bible. If I want to see evidence of evolution I can visit our excellent museum of natural history here in Pittsburgh. If I want to discuss evidence of the Bible I can talk to someone who has read the Bible. If I want to discuss evidence of evolutoin I can talk to someone who has read books from many different disciplines of scientific thought. If I want to challenge myself with new questions about the Bible I can open the Bible. If I want to challenge myself with new questions about evolution I can go outside, take a walk in the woods, scribble in my notebook and come back to this forum with a 47 page post full of questions: the important point here being that others like Lurch and Demon would either be able to answer them or point me in the right direction of someone who can.

It seems to be an echo of the oft expressed creationist cry that it is only fair that if a scientific theory that they oppose on religious grounds is presented in science class, i.e., evolution, then their side should also be presented on a equal basis with science.  I thought it might be of some interest to understand Jefferson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s motivations behind the above quote.  After Jefferson left office and retired to Monticello he continued to do business with a bookseller in Philadelphia named N. G. Dufief. Apparently on some occasions, Jefferson would purchase books that were sent directly to him at Monticello and Mr. Dufief would act as Jefferson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s agent for payment. Jefferson would then, from time to time, settle accounts with Mr. Dufief.  That seems to have been the case with a book by M. de Becourt entitled, Sur la Cr\u00c3\u00a9ation du Monde, un Syst\u00c3\u00aame d'Organisation Primitive. Jefferson had seen notice of the book\u00e2\u0080\u0099s publication and presumed it to be \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u00a6either a geological or astronomical work.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He ordered it to be sent to him upon publication with instructions that Mr. Dufief be contacted for payment. Thus, Mr. Dufief became involved with a book that he had never seen. Mr. Dufief extended credit to Mr. Jefferson, as was his custom, and paid for the book.  But such little technicalities never stopped the forces of good in the community. From the title alone criminal charges were brought against Mr. Dufief for crimes against religion. I do not know to outcome of the case but presume that Mr. Dufief was acquitted. The quote that Debater got almost correct is from a letter that Jefferson wrote to Dufief about the matter. At the end of the letter Jefferson discusses settling accounts by adding the unknown price of Newton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Principia to his balance of $4.93 and sending it along to Philadelphia.  Here are Jefferson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s comments on the case of Mr. Dufief from a letter of April 19, 1814.", "label": "fact"}

BUT along come a man-made invention that allows those certain portions to live on which otherwise would have died. In once case - nylon, the other, the artificial heart. You call this evolution.  Nor is it 'natural selection' at work either, as in both cases the thing that enabled them to survive was not natural. What you have advanced as a proof of evolution actually proves what? Natural what? I suppose people with cochlear implants are new species too because they've learnt to hear.  Another view of this nylon-eating-bug is given...  \"Finally, Mr Cerutti is out of date about this new nylon digesting ability allegedly from a frame shift. New evidence shows that the ability was due to plasmids [e.g. K. Kato, et al., ?A plasmid encoding enzymes for nylon oligomer degradation: Nucleotide sequence analysis of pOAD2?, Microbiology (Reading) 141(10):2585?2590, 1995.] In fact, more than one species of bacteria have the ability, residing on plasmids. This suggests that the information probably already existed, and was just passed between different types of bacteria.\"   \"All that would be needed to enable an enzyme to digest nylon is a mutation causing loss of specificity in a proteolytic (protein-degrading) enzyme. This may seem surprising? How would a loss of information create a new ability? Answer: enzymes are usually tuned very precisely to only one type of molecule (the substrate). Loss of information would reduce the effectiveness of its primary function, but would enable it to degrade other substrates, too. Since both nylon and proteins are broken down by breaking amide linkages, a change in a proteolytic enzyme could also allow it to work on nylon. If this process were continued, the result would be a general enzyme with a weakly catalytic effect on the hydrolysis of too many chemicals to be useful where much selectivity is required. To put it into perspective, acids and alkalis also catalyze many hydrolysis reactions, but they also lack specificity. Indeed, an inhibitor of a protein degrading enzyme also inhibits the action of the nylon degrading enzyme\"  http://www.answersingenesis.org/home...e7-24-2000.asp  Talkorigins gave their usual doubletalk  \"Whilst this particular case does not \"prove\" evolution, it is consistent with, and supportive of, the theory of biological evolution.\"  Why do they say this? Because it's still a bacteria. It's not like it suddenly became a large multi-cellular organism. But it might just prove that this bug was so well designed that it can cope with newer situations. One site does say that it, the bacteria, had the capability already within it of change ? not resultant in ?mutations?, but more like switching on previously dormant apparatus. http://members.tripod.com/aslodge/id89.htm  One poster on another forum summed the problem up like this...  \" In order for species to advance there would have to be a net information gain, which isn't the case with nylon eating bacteria.  The bacteria gained the ability to digest nylon, therefore was able to survive in a new environment. Two distinct advantages  But, the bacteria lost its ability to survive in its old environment, eat its former diet and suffered a 98% loss in efficiency. Three disadvantages.  So by taking two steps forward and three steps backward, where is the net gain?   If nylon eating bacteria was \"proof\" of evolution, we would still be pond scum, but with the ability to digest whatever happened to become the primary food source.\"  http://www.christianforums.com/t52336", "label": "fact"}

{"text": "Well, that was badly stated. But we've been over this before and you still don't seem to grasp. No one claims that any particular living animal is descended from any particular fossil. However, given the nature of life that we do observe, where we can see many species of equus, 36 species of cat, 28 species of canid, 8 or 10 species of bear (with as many more extinct species), 850,000 species of beetle, and on and on, we conclude that life was similar in the past. And while we can look at a fossil species of theropod dinosaur and find many avian characteristics, we do not conclude that this fossil was ancestral to birds. But we know that there were probably many species of theropods that had avian characteristics, just like there are many animals with cat-like features. Recent discoveries are bearing out that conclusion. So we don't say that this fossil is ancestral to that fossil or to this living organism. But we do say that this fossil shows characteristics that we would expect in an ancestral form. Thus, Archaeopteryx is not claimed to be ancestral to birds - in fact, is is believed to have eventually gone extinct (in all three known species). What we do say is that Archaeopteryx shows characteristics of both theropod dinosaurs and birds. Is in one of a broad lineage of many species with such characteristics, at least one of which is ancestral to modern birds (but we can't determine which one or ones that might be).  And we haven't even gotten into the question of derived morphology. Why don't we assume that dogs are descended from some very dog-like artiodactyl? In fact, why do we conclude that these dog-like animals are, in fact, artiodactyls?", "label": "fact"}

The ATF shut down Red's Trading Shop on matters as insignificant as typos. So why aren't they going in and shutting down these rogue dealers if they're doing anything wrong? It's illegal to own an automatic weapon of any sort without a federal tax stamp, and it's not possible for civilians to own post-'86 model automatic weapons, so why isn't the ATF doing something about it if they're breaking the laws?

{"text": "Really?   If \"nature\" meant for all things to reproduce through heterosexual methods then maybe all other forms of reproduction would not exist, hmm. They would have been \"eliminated\" because heterosexuality is far superior. Think again. The majority of organisms on this planet reproduce using binary fission (bacteria dividing), asexual reproduction (there goes your \"individual gratification argument), and zygotic reproduction. None of these things require sexes of any type.   Even animals that have \"normal\" sexual reproduction can reproduce using a process known as parthenogenesis, in which only a female is required to produce offspring (turkeys and lizards do this). If homosexuality isn't natural or is inferior, then why do we see examples of it in nature. The bonobo (closely related to the chimpanzee) exhibits heterosexual and homosexual activity in both genders in the wild, and the bonobo and humans share a very common ancestor.   Look, you can't say that one way of reproduction is \"the standard\" since it is clear that different species reproduce in a variety of ways. You also can't say that homosexuality is a disorder if you follow your previous logic that what is \"natural\" is valid. Also, you said that heterosexuality is superior because it has a \"greater purpose\". By implying that something has a purpose, you stray from the realm of Science by assuming a teleology. If you want to assume that things were given \"purpose\" by some higher being, that's fine, but you'll have to stick to religion to defend your argument. In science, it is impossible to assume a purpose. For example, what is the purpose of a river? To flow to the ocean? To carve a canyon? To carry sediment? You can say what something is good at doing, or what it does, but you cannot say what it was \"made\" for (purpose) without implying some grand design that can be easily provided by your local religion. As for hetero and homosexuality, it can be said that heterosexuals are better at producing offspring than homosexuals. Does that automatically make heterosexuality superior based on the arbitrary criterion of number of offspring produced? So in the eyes of a value system that believes that something is valued higher that creates more offspring or \"life\", heterosexuality would be superior.

Life is not chaotic it is orderly and requires replication. Without this you just have a lot of chemicals mixing in an infinite variety.

{"text": "Fascinating - you blew right through your own usual misunderstandings of Darwinism and Darwinists and ended up with a sentence that is actually meaningful.   HGT (along with genetic drift) are important parts of modern evolutionary theory, but they do indeed have nothing to do with darwinian evolution sensu stricto, which does indeed insist on natural selection. This is why evolutionary biologists object to being called Darwinists in the sense that you and WW usually try to impose on us, and it is why we insist that there is more to evolution than natural selection or RM&NS alone, and it is why we talk about the Neodarwinian Synthesis and Modern Evolutionary Theory. HGT validates the modern ToE. Modern evolutionary theory incorporates Darwin's version, and lot's more. HGT is part of the \"lots more\".   Some versions of lateral gene transfer have been accepted and studied for many decades, notably versions of conjugation in bacteria. (It wasn't until biologists were able to start sequencing DNA in quantity that we were able to see all the retroviral DNA segments and so forth.)  When someone like Gould (for example) talks about Darwinian evolution, depending on context, they are talking about either 1) the historical early version of the ToE as Darwin envisaged it, 2) the position that natural selection is the dominant process in evolution, or 3) an instance of evolutionary change in which natural selection is inferred to have been by far the most significant process. Evolution has moved well beyond Darwin's initial ideas to include mutations, recombination, and genetic drift, including HGT, in all sorts of combinations with each other and with natural selection.  As Chemist says, once HGT has occurred, the new version with the new genes can easily find itself competing with the old version, providing another way that NS can be involved, but it doesn't have to be. NS is just not all there is to evolution.  I can't wait to see how you are going to misinterpret this next.", "label": "fact"}

The point I tried to advance is that people who are avidly pro-choice typically do not see any circumstances under which they would restrict abortions save for (in some instances) the third trimester. Thus, they would defend a woman's decision to obtain an abortion for the sole reason that she fears that the child will be one gender rather than the other.  It also would be interesting to know (since you felt the need to weight in) whether you support abortions performed solely for the purpose of gender selection?", "label": "fact"}

{"text": "The reality is this is no different the following link: ie...the animals who were fed one diet passed on traits differently than those who were fed another diet. Traits, according to evolutionists arise RANOCMLY. Get that, geniuses? RANDOMLY. This is not random. Structural damage in this case did not happen randomly....nor did the dengenerative effects to the fur, nervous systems, bones, allergies, and mental processes. Instead this was all dictated by the environment. Thus, despite the emergence of new traits in the milk/cooked food-fed diet of the one population, it had nothing to do with darwinian random mutation or natural selection. This is a hole. A huge hole....it's environmental evolution...that is, animals simply changing with a changing environment. Lamarckism predicts that the environment changes first, followed up by new traits. Neo-darwinists say that new traits arise before and/or unoriented to the environment, only to be then be selected.  I win.  And this is no different than the following:  http://www.the-scientist.com/2004/7/5/14/1/   Normally, the fur of agouti mice is yellow, brown, or a calico-like mixture of the two, depending on the number of attached methyl groups. But when Duke University researchers Jirtle and Waterland fed folic acid and other methyl-rich supplements to pregnant mothers, despite the fact that all offspring inherited exactly the same agouti gene (i.e., with no nucleotide differences), mice who received supplements had offspring with mostly brown fur, whereas mice without supplements gave birth to mostly yellow pups with a higher susceptibility to obesity, diabetes, and cancer.  LAMARCKJean-Baptiste Lamarck (1744\u00e2\u0080\u00931829)  The environmental ability of epigenetic inheritance may not necessarily bring to mind Lamarckian images of giraffes stretching their necks to reach the treetops (and then giving birth to progeny with similarly stretched necks), but it does give researchers reason to reconsider long-refuted notions about the inheritance of acquired characteristics. Eighteenth-century French naturalist Jean Baptiste de Lamarck proposed that environmental cues could cause phenotypic changes transmittable to offspring.   Checkmate, losers.  Oh, and by the way, electro-loser.....it doesn't matter if this diet experiment can be extrapolated to humans or not. (Of course I realize you are just spouting your mouth off just to hear your head rattle)...the reality is, though, these cats evolved new traits by way of non-darwinian mechanisms.

{"text": "Start with the largest most powerful calibur you can get and physically handle. Then consider:  Practice = lots of ammo.   Lots of ammo = cost increase with larger calibur.  Practice = responsible gun owner.  Training = responsible gun owner.  Large calibur = ability to stop the attack quickly.  Small calibur = less likely to exit your target and hit someone behind it.  Well placed shots from a small calibur are superior to a large calibur that missed.  As a bare minium take a training course that teaches you to handle low light conditions and drawing from a concealed holster. When you need it most are under conditions most favored by criminals, e.g. from behind, up close, in the dark, with suprise, or any combinations of them.  A good instructor will also inform you of all the legal implications of having to defend yourself, the implications of comming to the aid of other people, the legal implications of defense on public and private property, etc.  Personally I have made the decision that I WILL NOT help anyone in mortal danger whom I do not know. The legal implications if you are wrong are very drastic. You can never know the complete conditions of strangers and how they got to be in mortal danger, for all you know the person who just pulled out a gun may be an undercover cop. Thus I will only come to the aid for friends and family whom I know and thier business. My personal decision.  The guys at the gun store are interested with selling you a pistol with the highest profit margin. Not the best tool for you. Only way to find out is with trigger time and carry time on the pistol. So you may have to horse trade a few times until you find the right one.  My personal opinion? A very small .38 revolver with more than one holster. Sometimes you need to carry it on your ankle, sometimes in your pocket, or sometimes on your hip. Plus a ton of ammo for practice. The ammo you spend on practice can soon cost more than the pistol.  Los of inexpensive, reliable, and well built .38's. Not a lot of fun to shoot, but hey, this is a tool with a very specific purpose. Of course of you can deal with more, by all means upgrade to more. Your not going to place a sniper shot between the eyes of a felon. Most likely you will need it at night, very quickly, and at a little longer than \"knife fighting distances\".  I use a .45 auto. I shoot a full size .45 for fun. Train with the full size .45, but I carry a compact .45. The compact has exactly the same shape in my hand as the large .45, thus when I have to go the the small .45 quickly, it will retain the same operation and configuration in my hand as the large .45. The large .45 has more fun factor, not a lot of fun to carry a big piece of steel on your hip all day.  Plus I reload the .45 empties. The cost of a large calibur with reloading becomes as much as a smaller calibur when the ammo is store bought. The time spent reloading keeps me out of bars on week nights and my girlfriend more comforted.  By the end of the day, after carrying even the compact .45. I wish I had a small .38. The most effecient solution I have seen was a friend who both had a .357 magnum and .22 of the same pistol. He practiced with the .22 pistol all he wanted and very cheaply. Shot the .357 magnum just enough to practice with the recoil. The .22 and .357 had exactly the same size, shape, and trigger pull.  My $.02", "label": "fact"}

{"text": "So, you think there is a God? Bad design does not equate to no design. It really is a poor argument.  Much of the force of Darwin's arguments deal with bad design. I invite anyone to post any of Darwin's arguments that specifically outline his case against design because of \"bad\" design.   That said, consider this, your car is said to operate at 25% fuel efficiency. One could claim then the car is 75% bad design, therefore it is not designed, and if it is, certainly not by anyone of any intelligence.  Your audio CD's have Reed-Solomon error correction because the read/write process is full of errors that need correcting. Cleary this is \"bad design\" that engineers would create read/write heads that make so many errors in the first place. Same with modems and host of other devices. Clearly if in the remote chance these bad designs are evidence of design, the designers must be clueless!  Poorly designed dramas have villains and heroes. Clearly a drama (even a divine drama) is poorly designed if it has villains in the story. All the characters should be Pollyanna and there should be no great tragedies on the road to a happy ending. Life and the Divine drama, like CD's and cars, are clearly not designed, or at least not designed by anyone with intelligence, because of all the bad design woven into the designs.  The reason audio CD's have so many read/write errors which are corrected Reed-Solomon error correction (somewhat like us reading someone's writing and mentally correcting spelling and grammar errors) is that it is the most optimal way to get as much data on a CD as possible. The tightest packing of data implies the highest amount of errors based on the Shannon capacity theorem.  The Mp3's and JPEGS are even more \"error\" prone in that they are inexact representations of the original sound or picture, but the goal was not fidelity but compactness.  A similar consideration is for the 75% inefficiency for cars. The goal is for higher acceleration and agility and cost, etc., not fuel efficiency.   The point is \"bad\" design, in the grand scheme of things, might not be bad design after all.   The high rate of sickness and death, the eventual death of the universe as predicted by the 2nd law of thermodynamics are not evidences that the Designer is unwise, any more than the many errors in the read/write process of audio CD suggests the engineers of those devices are incompetent.  Origin of Species Chapter 13:  There is another and equally curious branch of the present subject; namely, the comparison not of the same part in different members of a class, but of the different parts or organs in the same individual. Most physiologists believe that the bones of the skull are homologous with that is correspond in number and in relative connexion with the elemental parts of a certain number of vertebrae. The anterior and posterior limbs in each member of the vertebrate and articulate classes are plainly homologous. We see the same law in comparing the wonderfully complex jaws and legs in crustaceans. It is familiar to almost every one, that in a flower the relative position of the sepals, petals, stamens, and pistils, as well as their intimate structure, are intelligible in the view that they consist of metamorphosed leaves, arranged in a spire. In monstrous plants, we often get direct evidence of the possibility of one organ being transformed into another; and we can actually see in embryonic crustaceans and in many other animals, and in flowers, that organs which when mature become extremely different, are at an early stage of growth exactly alike.   How inexplicable are these facts on the ordinary view of creation! Why should the brain be enclosed in a box composed of such numerous and such extraordinarily shaped pieces of bone? As Owen has remarked, the benefit derived from the yielding of the separate pieces in the act of parturition of mammals, will by no means explain the same construction in the skulls of birds. Why should similar bones have been created in the formation of the wing and leg of a bat, used as they are for such totally different purposes? Why should one crustacean, which has an extremely complex mouth formed of many parts, consequently always have fewer legs; or conversely, those with many legs have simpler mouths? Why should the sepals, petals, stamens, and pistils in any individual flower, though fitted for such widely different purposes, be all constructed on the same pattern ?   On the theory of natural selection, we can satisfactorily answer these questions.  Homology was a pre-darwinian idea with the term coined by Owen who rather despised Darwin and his ideas.  Darwin tries to argue why a Designer would not use the same for the same function. He says homology is evidence of an unwise design. The premise is a Creator wouldn't be so inefficient.  But, unless one has a handle on the teleological goal, one is free to fabricate all manner of \"bad design\" arguments (for example read/write errors in audio CD's or fuel inefficient cars).   The Biotic Message Theory suggest the teleological goal for biotic reality is to communicate to humans that there is one Designer and author of life, and that life could not have evolved. Like a great novel, the \"imperfections\" of biology are part of a larger plot.  It is turning out, Darwin's argument from homology is a concept in crisis.", "label": "fact"}

Indeed, I would say it is what psychologists call emergent downward causality.  As for the role of God, science has not disproven any of it. Science has explained how things occur but that does not eliminate the possibility of god nor does it limit what god does. We would simply not be understanding gods fit in the science of it. That makes sense given that god is considered infinite and we are finite. I think the soul is what gives us the possibility of even imagining the infinite. The idea that we can see beyond what we are or even to conceptualize such things gives a clue that there is more to us than meets the eye.  I do not see why God and science cannot coexist. Even evolution and creation. Forget planting evidence. That is too far fetched. I would rather think that it is more likely that what God says actually fits the evidence even though we cannot understand it. I do not know about God or \"not god\" (if you will) but if there is a God then the idea that he is beyond what I can actually conceive and yet completely conceivable makes sense for that kind of being.

{"text": "One cannot have a controled experiment, as one can in the hard sciences. Psychology, anthropology and other disciplines also do not allow for controlled experiments. However, as with these other fields, one can do a detailed analysis of events that do occur to see if there is a common trend. For example, if people claim to see a supernatural event, take them aside separately to question them about the details. If one can be sure that they didn't get a chance to coordinate the details ahead of time and, nevertheless, the details match, then that would be evidence supporting the supernatural. If this happens consistently, then it would start giving strong support to the existence of a supernatural.  Unfortunately, though there are occasional events that remain unexplained, we all know that the great majority of events have not resulted in any conclusive evidence of a supernatural and often they are shown to be simply fraudulent or due to psychological misinterpretation. Since so many of these claims about the supernatural have proven to be dead ends, it is understandable that people should automatically be wary of anyone's claim toward supernatural proof, which has led to the very subject being essentially taboo in intellectual circles. That is unfortunate. If there actually was a supernatural and did manifest itself, then it might never be discovered because any genuine evidence presented would be automatically ignored because of the taboo.

{"text": "This is where intuitive, ready agreement with the opening paragraph starts to get the reader into trouble. All facts are interpreted according to presuppositions, so it's only fair that Creationists should get to bring their presuppositions to the table just like everyone else, right?  Well, let's apply that same blanket reasoning to other situations and see what happens. Imagine a juror whose personal prejudices lead him to presuppose the guilt of a defendant based on her skin colour, and to interpret the facts of the case accordingly. Should he be allowed to sit in judgement? Of course not - but according to the reasoning presented by AiG that leaves us in an impossible position: by eliminating those jurors predisposed to return a guilty verdict based upon race, we necessarily cede the court to those predisposed to return an innocent verdict based upon race.  Our intuition rightly rebels at this false dichotomy. We readily apprehend the existence of a middle ground wherein skin colour confers neither automatic guilt nor automatic innocence. Ah, but! Is that neutrality itself not merely another presupposition, another axiom through which the facts are being interpreted? One might protest that it is not, that the irrelevance of skin colour as a determinant of guilt can be determined empirically. But it would be in vain, because there are, after all, no such thing as 'brute facts'. The data you supply to justify your position only do so when interpreted according to your presupposition that guilt can be race-agnostic. To someone whose presupposition is otherwise, your 'facts' mean something quite different - they might for instance mean the research itself must be corrupt and biased, or at least faulty in some unknown way.  In short, following Ken Ham's reasoning we find ourselves deep in a rabbit hole with no end in sight. We can venture to justify no opinion or belief, because the facts that appear to support one may upon the least whim be reinterpreted in the light of another. I may if I so choose presuppose the bible to be the work of the devil himself, and I am not to be chastised nor deterred through argument, for the axioms by which I choose to interpret the world are, in Ken's eyes, inviolate.  This is hardly the result Ken could have intended. What's gone wrong? Why has his fair-minded attempt to level the playing field backfired so badly?  The answer, of course, is that the playing field isn't really level.  Every once in a while someone will decide that he can fly, and attempt to demonstrate this facility to the world by leaping from a high place. The world thus far has remained largely unimpressed. This is an extreme example of what can happen when the axioms one uses to interpret the world conflict with those upon which it really operates, and it provides the first key to unlocking our dilemma:  Good axioms yield accurate predictions.  As Ken rightly observed, known facts are always subject to interpretation. But the reverse process, the prediction of facts yet to come based on a formulated theory, is not. In making a prediction we are forced to stop shoehorning data into our preconceived worldview and make a statement about what we will find. This yields the closest thing we have to a truly objective measurement of congruence between theory and reality.  This understanding allows us to validate or repudiate the presuppositions we bring to bear on the facts at our disposal. The racist juror would from the outset predict the evidence to be presented would turn out to be stacked against the defendant, but his low 'hit rate' would invalidate his axiom.  So, part of what distinguishes Creationism from mainstream scientific understanding is that, in hindsight and on an ongoing basis its predictions fall wide of the mark. The discovery of shared pseudogenes should have been all but impossible, as should identically located retroviral insertions. We should not have found fossils at all, let alone a nested hierarchy of forms. We should not have been able to observe evolution and speciation. We should not have been able to see very distant stars and galaxies.  All of these unexpected face-plants for Creationism have of course been rationalised away after the fact. Shared pseudogenes must all have some function we don't know about; there must be some determinism in the location of ERVs; fossils and the geological column were all laid down in the Great Flood; the speed of light and the rate of decay of radioactive materials were different in the past. But these rationalisations entail further predictions: we ought not to be able to safely remove pseudogenes if they are functional - but we can. If ERV insertion is deterministic we should see that in the lab - but we don't. If fossils were laid down by the flood we wouldn't expect similar animals to be sorted by depth according to the number of cusps on a back tooth, or to be buried in amongst consistent strata of pollen grains, and we wouldn't expect there to be anything like as much limestone. If decay rates had been high enough in the past to explain what we see today in just 10,000 years, we ought to now be breathing incandescent rock vapour instead of air. And so on.  Science also changes to accommodate the unexpected - but as often as not the 'unexpected' has been discovered by scientists extrapolating existing theories to their logical conclusions, predicting something we didn't initially suspect but which has later been confirmed. And that's the bottom line: Creationism and science both evolve as new facts emerge, but while the result for science has been a trend towards better and more accurate predictions, indicative of closing the gap between theory and reality, Creationism remains a tumbling snowball of post-hoc rationalisation growing around a hard core of sacred axioms that - it would certainly appear thus far - make it impossible for the convergence of prediction and reality to occur.", "label": "fact"}

And at a smaller scale, it does not apply to any individual organism: it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tell us that in order for organism X to be considered living that it must reproduce (take for example, mules).   Must All Living Organisms Die?  An implicit assumption in the last several arguments is that all living things must die. After all, if a living organism didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t die, then it wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to reproduce in order to persist, even for 4 billion years. We need to ask, \u00e2\u0080\u009cDoes this assumption of universal death hold?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Yes, well, at least for all instances of life that we currently know of. Thus, it is a conclusion based on induction, not on necessity.   Consider a species capable of repairing itself indefinitely. Sound far fetched? Well, we humans ourselves are desiring to do just that. And to an extremely limited degree, we have succeeded. Of course, we still have an enormous distance left before fully succeeding, but if we were to eventually do so, then could it really be said that reproduction is a requirement to consider humans as being alive? No. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be like \u00e2\u0080\u009cimmortal mules\u00e2\u0080\u009d: we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be alive, yet incapable of reproducing \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 but unlike mules, we wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to be continually replaced by reproduction. After all, we could stop reproducing (women might really like that idea!) and instead focus on repairing those that currently exist.  Perhaps, though, we \u00e2\u0080\u009cimmortal mules\u00e2\u0080\u009d, by simply repairing ourselves and maintaining the status quo, would still somehow die: after all, nature shows us that those organisms that don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t adapt to the ever changing conditions on Earth just don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t last. Perhaps the changes in our environment would be too dramatic to be handled by simply replacing what is damaged with a new part. This line of reasoning fails since our intent is not simply to repair ourselves, but to improve ourselves as well. Humans intend to direct their own bodily evolution, either via installed hardware or through genetic manipulations, adapting our bodies to changes in the environment.   And if we ever reach this ultimate goal (is it a good goal?!), then we could save energy by modifying our bodies to eliminate the no-longer-required processes involved in reproduction .

{"text": "Well, stated that way, there is no problem with religion and evolution co-existing. Many evolutionary biologists are religious. Dr. Kenneth Miller of Brown U. is a practicing Christian and a respected evolutionary biologist. He engages in debates from time to time with creationists and ID proponents. There is little problem with the theories of evolution and most main-line religions around the world.  The real debate is between a minority of United States fundamentalist christians and science in general. You have seen on this board that even though the theories of evolution are biological, several creationists have insisted that somehow there is a grand theory of evolution that includes the origin of the universe, the galaxies, the solar system, the planets, the earth, and life on earth. Typicaly, creationists claim that they don't oppose science but only evolution - and by that they mean cosmology, astronomy, astrophysics, planetary physics, biochemistry, geology, most of physics (relativity, quantum mechanics, thermodynamics), genetics, molecular biology, population genetics, embryology (evo-devo), paleontology, paleoanthropology, and on and on. What is not opposed is trivial and limited that data upon which scientific theory is built, not the theories.  So to answer the question can religion and evolution co-exist? Without question. Evolutionary scientists do not study matters outside the domain of science. Science is naturalistic - methodological naturalism - and cannot observe and study the supernatural. The supernatural cannot be quantified. I have yet to see an equation that represents the power of God. That is not to claim that things outside of science do not exist or are not valid and important. It is just that science is not the proper tool for the study of such matters. Questions of faith and morals fall in other domains - theology and religion, for example.  Can creationism and science co-exist? Probably not. But the problem is not with science. It is with creationism. Creationism establishes its conclusions before any evidence is examined based on \"divine revelation.\" The problem arises when science, without regard to religion, uses the scientific method to arrive at conclusions that cannot be reconciled with creationist conclusions. This makes science the evil work of Satan, and it means that scientists are trying to escape responsibility to a god based on primitive mythology.", "label": "fact"}

That was two days after Crowder reached a plea bargain with federal prosecutors in Minneapolis for his role in the plot to build Molotov cocktails and attack the GOP convention in September 2008.  Crowder and McKay were part of a group of activists that had gone to the Twin Cities to take part in street demonstrations. The FBI had infiltrated the group with Darby. Crowder and McKay built eight of the gasoline firebombs but didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t use them, a fact law enforcement officials credited to Darby.  Members of the Austin protest community heaped scorn on Darby, saying he had betrayed longtime friends and colleagues.  Kibby, who lives in Houston, is free on bond. If convicted, she could face 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. She could not be reached for comment.

The evolution of something as complex as a wing proceeds by a lot of intermediate steps, each one of them being useful, or at least associated with something useful. We don't see humans or dogs or alligators suddenly sprouting wings because that would require massive wholesale genomic, and probably epigenetic, change. What we do see are more mundane, less drastic variations which can accumulate over time.  It's tempting to think \"wings evolving from arms; huh, what about the millions of years when they were neither; how could they have been 'fittest'?\" The mistake there is in visualising a straightforward morph from 'then' to 'now', as if the organism knew where it was headed. A better way to imagine it is via an intermediate stage where the arms were still useful as arms, but also conferred an aerodynamic advantage, such as we see in flying squirrels today. If the original purpose of the arms later becomes less important, those features can atrophy while improved aerodynamic qualities remain strongly selected. The divergence of mice and bats is likely to have followed just such a pattern; who knows, in another ten million years we might see descendents of flying squirrels that are as adept in the air as bats are today.  So in a sense, 'flying squirrels' are your answer. I can't guarantee they'll evolve more and more wing-like structures over the next few million years, but it's possible.", "label": "fact"}

It's natural selection. There are other mechanisms, of course, so that's not the only one.  We already know that Human brain development could possible have occured due to a new diet, in a new area.

{"text": "But it does have an answer, as long as (and I see no reason to infer otherwise) 'organisation' is defined, as are many scientific concepts, as a human-imposed description of the sum of a multitude of physical cause/effect phenomena. Remember when we argued about entropy? I essentially stated (or admitted, if you want to see it that way) that the concepts that we label 'entropy', 'order', 'disorder' and even 'particle' are human-imposed abstracts applied for ease of understanding.   Again referencing a point I have previously made, the maths that backs up the areas of physics (which necessarily includes chemistry/biology) that are confirmed with near-certitude, is equally as-certain-as-possible, but is impossible to satisfactorily translate into ordinary language; hence the terms employed that, relative to the maths, are so vague and easily misinterpretable. My best example is the uncertainty principle, which can be explained in words, but can only be shown to be an uncontrevertible fact by using maths. The great thing about the UP is that it is not even necessary to perform a real experiment; given certain parameters (already known) the UP is inevitable.  The POV I am justifying here is one that does not even begin to reference such terms as 'organisation' and what may 'drive' it. This may be a personal thing, but ideally IMHO the scientific method should never assume 'organisation' or 'drives', it should only look at facts and figures. After this analysis has been done mathematically, there may (and indeed always are) patterns discernible that we, humans, can label 'organisation' and 'drives', but these things do not exist in and of themselves. They are abstracts, simplifications, words used so that we do not have to talk in complex equations.  Given all this, when we come to the Four Fundamental Forces, we do actually know (ie we are almost certain) that these phenomena are a part of the world of facts and figures, not part of the world of human-imposed concepts. My best supporting argument for this is that the FFFs cannot (yet) be further reduced to anything simpler. There are plenty of other 'forces' such as kinetic energy, potential energy etc that derive their very existence from the FFFs. The FFFs are anything but non-material, as they are intermediated by known, defined, observed particles/quanta or in the case of gravity, the medium of spacetime.

{"text": "First of all, let's compare the \"B\" specimen in this fossil link to the modern specimen and point out any significant difference to me. Secondly, shortly after the discovery was made of the living fish, but before the fix was in to excuse the massive assumptions evolutionists previously made regarding what the fossil represented, Nat Geo reported the truth about the claims evolutions had made prior to finding this fish alive and well and basically unchanged after an alleged hundreds of millions of years.  One example that amply demonstrates the accuracy of evolutionary dating and sequencing of fossil fish, or any fossil for that matter, would be the story of the coelacanth. This is a genuine fish story. For many years evolutionists had assured us that the coelacanth, a member of the crossopterygian family and a supposed link to amphibians, had most definitely been extinct for at least sixty million years, at least according to their precise methods of dating and their exact analysis of the indisputable evidence of the fossil record. No doubt about it, the coelacanth died out millennia ago along with the dinosaurs, at least until a living coelacanth was dredged up off the coast of Africa in 1938.  Since then hundreds of live coelacanths have been found. In the June, 1988 National Geographic Magazine they featured numerous pictures of the coelacanth swimming around in the ocean depths, where they differ very little from the ones found entombed in the fossil layers, thus providing no evidence of any kind of evolution occurring for the coelacanth, despite the fact that the evolutionists say these fish have been swimming around for at least four hundred million years.  The ancient coelacanths, from the first time they appeared in the fossil record were virtually identical to the living ones we find at the present day, extending all the way back through the geologic record past the Paleogene age of the mammals (63 million years), before the Cretaceous and Jurassic age of the dinosaurs (100 million through 225 million years ago), before the Triassic age of early mammals (200 million through 250 million years ago), before the Permian age of early reptiles (250 million through 300 million years ago), before the Carboniferous age (300 million through 370 million years ago), all the way back to the Devonian era, 400 million years ago in the fossil record, according to the time scale of the evolutionists.  Initially it couldn't be admitted that a living coelacanth had appeared that was identical to a species that evolutionists had calmly assured us was extinct for so many millions of years.  Thus when a live example of this extinct fish had been found, J.L.B. Smith, a chemist and ichthyologist at Rhodes University in Grahamstown University, South Africa, pronounced it an entirely new genus and species, differentfrom any coelacanth previously recorded as fossils. Smith gave the living coelacanth a very scientific name, Latimeria chalumnae, after Marjorie Courtenay-Latimer who discovered the fish, and the mouth of the Chalumna River where it was captured.  Just how different is this fish from the ancient coelacanth? On pp.832 of the National Geographic article of 1988, there is a study of the comparative anatomy between the living and ancient coelacanth with this caption next to pictures of each one. They state: \"LIKE CARBON COPIES, the tail of a live coelacanth and a 140-million year-old fossil virtually match.\"  They go on to report: \"Few creatures have endured such an immense span of time with so little change as the coelacanth. The cut-away drawing of a present-day specimen seems almost identical with the 140-million year-old fossil found in a quarry in southern West Germany. It is that extraordinary lack of change that enabled Professor J.L.B. Smith in Grahamstown to identify the coelacanth caught in South Africa in 1938 from a rough sketch, although he had never seen a live specimen.\"(30)  Throughout the entire history of vertebrate animals the coelacanth appears, differing very little in structure, showing absolutely no signs of evolving from one species and/or changing into any other kind of species through the supposed millions of years of it's existence. It would seem that giving the newly discovered living coelacanth the status of an entirely new species and genus was simply to hide their embarrassment while they were scrambling to come up with some kind of an explanation as to why they had been so sure that it had been extinct for sixty million years. I think there's something fishy here in what the evolutionists have been trying to tell us. This is true of virtually all fossils found, whether sharks or sand-dollars, they show no signs of evolutionary change to or from another distinct species.  Evolutionists had long speculated that the crossopterygians (the class of fish including the coelacanth), because they had bony elements in their fins, may have had the ability to walk while in the water on the floor of the sea, which somehow led to the development of legs to walk on the land.  This scenario was put to rest when the authors wrote in the National Geographic article: \"Our films settled another question that has intrigued scientists: whether the coelacanth can walk on its lobed fins. Though we observed several individuals resting with their fins braced against the sea bottom, we never saw any of them walk, and it appears the fish is unable to do so.\"(31)  It should be noted that the coelacanth does not lay eggs like most fish, amphibians and reptiles do, but gives live birth. Thus as evolutionists had tried to connect the coelacanth with some unknown link between amphibians and fish, this would put it in a rather dubious position as an intermediary candidate. The red-tailed sun perch off the northwest coast of the United States also gives live birth after nine months, two thirds of all existing sharks give birth to live, wriggling, little, sharks, some lizards give live birth, so a supposed evolutionary sequence demonstrating how fish, amphibians and reptiles lay eggs while only mammals and marsupials give live birth would be in serious trouble.  The Fossil Record  Here's the relevant point of exposing how evolutionists dealt with defining the Coelacanth. Before evolutionists knew that living examples of this fish existed, they never even hesitated in taking the observable physical features it exhibited and thought nothing of creating a completely inaccurate and totally fictional biography of that fish's evolutionary journey. They not only claimed that it crawled on the Sea bottom which proved it was an intermediary fish, but they made assumptions based on the fact that it birthed its young live rather than being an egg layer.  Here is Hans Fricke's own story regarding the investigation into the coelacanths natural habitat which Nat Geo's story is based upon. And notice the last paragraph in the story. The Fish That Time Forgot - Sidebar - MSN Encarta IT SAY'S THIS:  I confess I'm sorry we never saw a coelacanth walk on its fins. Professor Smith himself nicknamed the coelacanth Old Fourlegs in the belief that the creature actually did walk upon the seafloor like a seal on its flippers. Alas, that does not seem to be the case. For every myth we dispelled, however, I'm certain there are a dozen fascinating discoveries still to be made. In short, we have just begun to know the coelacanth.  So even though this man is in no way an anti-evolutionist, even he had to admit that what had been not only assumed to be true about the coelacanth, but had been widely reported as a discovery which was supported by documented fossil evidence, was a complete myth. Which I believe and assert can be said for all of the so called evidence which exists for the pseudo science of evolution.", "label": "fact"}

Miller, 307 U.S. 174, 178, 59 S.Ct. 816, 818, 83 L.Ed. 1206 (1939) (second amendment applies only to weapons that have a 'reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia.')\"  Thomas v. Members of City Council of Portland (1st Cir. 1984)   \"Appellant Raymond Rybar, Jr. was convicted following a conditional guilty plea to two counts of violating 18 U.S.C. Section(s) 922(o), which makes it 'unlawful for any person to transfer or possess a machine gun.' On appeal, he argues that the district court erred in rejecting his challenge to that provision as beyond Congress' commerce power and as violating the Second Amendment. Neither challenge is persuasive....In support, Rybar cites, paradoxically, the Supreme Court decision in United States v. Miller, 307 U.S. 174 (1939), where the Court upheld the constitutionality of a firearms-registration requirement against a Second Amendment challenge. Rybar draws on that holding, relying on the Miller Court's observation that the sawed-off shotgun in question had not been shown to bear 'some reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia.' Brief of Appellant at 24-25; Miller, 307 U.S. at 178. Drawing from that language the contra positive implication, Rybar suggests that because the military utility of the machine guns proscribed by Section(s) 922(o) is clear, a result contrary to that reached in Miller is required, and the statute is therefore invalid under the Second Amendment....We note first that however clear the Court's suggestion that the firearm before it lacked the necessary military character, it did not state that such character alone would be sufficient to secure Second Amendment protection. In fact, the Miller Court assigned no special importance to the character of the weapon itself, but instead demanded a reasonable relationship between its 'possession or use' and militia related activity....Rybar's invocation of this statute does nothing to establish that his firearm possession bears a reasonable relationship to 'the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia,' as required in Miller, 307 U.S. at 178. \"  U.S. v.

Yet testing is not only possible but easy. Last year my daughter's car hit a deer. The deer's carcass wasn't found but it would have had pieces of glass embedded in it. Testing those pieces would show that they came from the windshield of a Pontiac Sunfire. That eliminates the alien spaceship hypothesis. (Unless you propose the ad hoc hypothesis that the spaceship coincidentally had glass identical to that of a Pontiace Sunfire. However, that ad hoc hypothesis can't be independently tested and is therefore invalid).", "label": "fact"}

Hear, Israel, you are drawing near today to battle against your enemies. Do not let your heart be faint; do not fear nor tremble, nor be terrified before their faces. 4 For Jehovah your God is He who is going before you, to fight for you with your enemies, to save you. 5 And the officers shall speak to the people, saying, who is the man that has built a new house, and has not dedicated it? Let him go and return to his house, that he not die in battle and another man dedicate it. 6 And who is the man that has planted a vineyard, and has not used its fruit? Let him go and return to his house, that he not die in battle, and another man use its fruit. 7 And who is the man who has betrothed a woman, and has not taken her? Let him go and return to his house, that he not die in the battle, and another man take her. 8 And the officers shall speak further to the people, and say, Who is the man who is afraid, and faint of heart? Let him go and return to his house; then the heart of his brothers will not melt like his heart. 9 And it shall be, when the officers have finished speaking to the people, commanders of the armies shall be appointed at the head of the people.  10 When you come near a city to fight against it, then call to it for peace. 11 And it shall be, if it answers peace to you, and shall open to you, then it shall be that all the people found in it shall be forced laborers for you, and shall serve you. 12 And if it shall not make peace with you, and shall make war with you, then you shall lay siege against it. 13 And Jehovah your God shall give it into your hand; and you shall strike every male of it by the mouth of the sword. 14 Only, the women, and the little ones, and the livestock, and all in the city, all its plunder, you shall seize for yourself.

{"text": "To clarify: is it the womans choice whether the guy is prosecuted after he has been named, or is it the states? By what you've said so far, it seems that all this law does is give woman the power to punish men if they get pregnant by them; despite the fact that the woman was just as consenting as the man at the time of the coitus.  There are also contraceptive paths for women that don't involve condoms. If a woman gets pregnant because she forgot to take the pill that morning and always relied on that rather than on condoms to stop her getting pregnant, why should the man be punished?  The message here should be simple. If you don't want an abortion, and aren't currently in a position where you can support your children, don't have unprotected sex. At the moment, it is the woman's choice alone whether she has an abortion or not, so it is the woman who has to look after the child if she is single after its birth. If you want to add men to that equation, you have to add them in both places - give them the legal right to 'have an abortion' (force their partner to have one), and make them legally responsible for the child if they do not do so. Then you have an entirely connected couple from coitus onwards; both consenting to sex, both choosing not to have an abortion and both caring for the child after birth. I doubt that that law would be a popular one, either - but if you are going to force a man to take equal legal responsibility for a child, you have to give them equal legal opportunity to avoid it.", "label": "fact"}

This is only one of several examples of quite rapid evolution that has been observed by the Grants on Daphne Major over what must now be about 30 years.  Here's the situation. Essentially, there are two food sources from two different plants for the finches on Daphne Major. One is a small seed - easily cracked. The other is a large hard shelled seed. At one time, during a drought, the Grants observed that some native finches, Geospiza fortis, evolved larger beaks that enabled them to eat the larger, hard shelled seeds. In other words, the bell curve was extended at the large bill size end. The article (and I presume the paper published by the Grants) recounts the colonization of Daphne Major by a larger ground finch, G. magnirostris, with a correspondingly larger bill. The point is that large G. fortis and small G. magnirostris are similar in size, having similar beak size. As a result, they directly competed for scarce resources. As a result, large beaked G. fortis and small beaked G. magnirostris were at a reproductive disadvantage. As a result, the smaller beaked G. fortis evolved to specialize in the smaller, more easily cracked seeds that G. magnirostris had difficulty in picking up, while G. magnirostris evolved to specialize in the larger, hard shelled seeds.

Alarmists Claim Debate Over  On June 1, California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger (R) claimed \"the debate is over\" and global warming alarmists' predictions had carried the day.  The Natural Resources Defense Council on June 9 declared, \"The world's leading scientists now agree that global warming is real and is happening right now. According to their forecasts, extreme changes in climate could produce a future in which erratic and chaotic weather, melting ice caps and rising sea levels usher in an era of drought, crop failure, famine, flood and mass extinctions.\"  On June 13, USA Today declared, \"The debate's over: Globe is Warming.\" In support of its claim, the newspaper cited the positions of some left-leaning religious groups, some corporations who will reap a financial windfall from a switch to alternative fuel sources, and some politicians.  Scientists Disagree  While each of the above claims from non-scientists received significant media coverage, leading climatologists spent the month of June rebutting such proclamations.  Atmospheric physicist S. Fred Singer, professor emeritus of environmental sciences at the University of Virginia and former director of the U.S. Weather Satellite Service, sent a letter to the editor of USA Today directly refuting its claim. \"Your editorial ... claim[s] the global warming debate is over. Not so,\" wrote Singer.  Singer wrote, \"Sea level will continue to rise by only seven inches per century as it has for thousands of years no matter what we do or what the EPA [U.S. Environmental Protection Agency] says. And temperatures in the next 100 years will likely rise by less than one degree F--not exactly a catastrophe.\"  Added Singer in a subsequent letter to the Canadian media, \"Thousands of scientists from many countries now fully understand that Kyoto and other efforts to control human emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) are ineffective and entirely unfounded scientifically.  \"Even if you ignore the enormous cost of Kyoto (estimated recently by Prof. George Taylor of Oregon State University--see http://www.sitewave.net/news/s49p628.htm--at one trillion U.S. dollars a year for full implementation in OECD countries), climate science research is rapidly moving AWAY from the hypothesis that the human release of greenhouse gases, specifically CO2, is in any way significantly contributing to global climate change.\"  Sun Called Primary Cause  \"If we just look at the historical data, there is a scientific consensus that the global mean temperature has risen modestly during the twentieth century,\" said Myron Ebell, director of global warming and environmental policy at the Competitive Enterprise Institute. \"The impacts have been small and probably beneficial in aggregate. This historical data puts the onus of demonstration on those who think this gradual warming trend will accelerate and lead to dire consequences.\"  The controlling driver of global temperature fluctuations, according to Dr. Benny Peiser of England's John Moore's University, is solar ray activity. \"Six eminent researchers from the Russian Academy of Science and the Israel Space Agency have just published a startling paper in one of the world's leading space science journals. The team of solar physicists claims to have come up with compelling evidence that changes in cosmic ray intensity and variations in solar activity have been driving much of the Earth's climate,\" Peiser was quoted as saying in the May 17 National Post.  Moreover, reports Peiser, Jan Veizer, one of Canada's top earth scientists, published a comprehensive review of recent findings and concluded, \"empirical observations on all time scales point to celestial phenomena as the principal driver of climate, with greenhouse gases acting only as potential amplifiers.\"  Added Peiser, \"In fact, the explicit and implicit rejection of the 'consensus' is not restricted to individual scientists. It also includes distinguished scientific organizations such as the Russian Academy of Science and the U.S. Association of State Climatologists, both of which are highly skeptical of the whole idea.\"  Heartland Institute - Article  And here's more:  Renowned Scientist Defects From Belief in Global Warming \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Caps Year of Vindication for Skeptics  October 17, 2006  October 17, 2006  Washington DC - One of the most decorated French geophysicists has converted from a believer in manmade catastrophic global warming to a climate skeptic. This latest defector from the global warming camp caps a year in which numerous scientific studies have bolstered the claims of climate skeptics. Scientific studies that debunk the dire predictions of human-caused global warming have continued to accumulate and many believe the new science is shattering the media-promoted scientific \u00e2\u0080\u009cconsensus\u00e2\u0080\u009d on climate alarmism.  Claude Allegre, a former government official and an active member of France\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Socialist Party, wrote an editorial on September 21, 2006 in the French newspaper L'Express titled \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Snows of Kilimanjaro\u00e2\u0080\u009d (For English Translation, click here: U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works ) detailing his newfound skepticism about manmade global warming. See: http://www.lexpress.fr/idees/tribune...asp?ida=451670 Allegre wrote that the \u00e2\u0080\u009ccause of climate change remains unknown\u00e2\u0080\u009d and pointed out that Kilimanjaro is not losing snow due to global warming, but to local land use and precipitation changes. Allegre also pointed out that studies show that Antarctic snowfall rate has been stable over the past 30 years and the continent is actually gaining ice.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cFollowing the month of August experienced by the northern half of France, the prophets of doom of global warming will have a lot on their plate in order to make our fellow countrymen swallow their certitudes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Allegre wrote. He also accused proponents of manmade catastrophic global warming of being motivated by money, noting that \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe ecology of helpless protesting has become a very lucrative business for some people!\u00e2\u0080\u009d  Allegre, a member of both the French and U.S. Academy of Sciences, had previously expressed concern about manmade global warming. \"By burning fossil fuels, man enhanced the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere which has raised the global mean temperature by half a degree in the last century,\" Allegre wrote 20 years ago. In addition, Allegre was one of 1500 scientists who signed a November 18, 1992 letter titled \u00e2\u0080\u009cWorld Scientists' Warning to Humanity\u00e2\u0080\u009d in which the scientists warned that global warming\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cpotential risks are very great.\u00e2\u0080\u009d See: Warning to Humanity  Allegre has authored more than 100 scientific articles, written 11 books and received numerous scientific awards including the Goldschmidt Medal from the Geochemical Society of the United States.  Allegre's conversion to a climate skeptic comes at a time when global warming alarmists have insisted that there is a \u00e2\u0080\u009cconsensus\u00e2\u0080\u009d about manmade global warming. Proponents of global warming have ratcheted up the level of rhetoric on climate skeptics recently. An environmental magazine in September called for Nuremberg-style trials for global warming skeptics and CBS News \u00e2\u0080\u009c60 Minutes\u00e2\u0080\u009d correspondent Scott Pelley compared skeptics to \u00e2\u0080\u009cHolocaust deniers.\u00e2\u0080\u009d See: U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works & Scott Pelley And Catherine Herrick On Global Warming Coverage - Public Eye In addition, former Vice President Al Gore has repeatedly referred to skeptics as \"global warming deniers.\"  This increase in rhetorical flourish comes at a time when new climate science research continues to unravel the global warming alarmists\u00e2\u0080\u0099 computer model predictions of future climatic doom and vindicate skeptics.  60 Scientists Debunk Global Warming Fears  Earlier this year, a group of prominent scientists came forward to question the so-called \u00e2\u0080\u009cconsensus\u00e2\u0080\u009d that the Earth faces a \u00e2\u0080\u009cclimate emergency.\u00e2\u0080\u009d On April 6, 2006, 60 scientists wrote a letter to the Canadian Prime Minister asserting that the science is deteriorating from underneath global warming alarmists.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cObservational evidence does not support today's computer climate models, so there is little reason to trust model predictions of the future\u00e2\u0080\u00a6Significant [scientific] advances have been made since the [Kyoto] protocol was created, many of which are taking us away from a concern about increasing greenhouse gases.

{"text": "It's bad enough that you claim to oppose evolution when you don't even know what it is, but to correct someone on logic and get it backwards is really silly. If you limit your claims of creation to the simple assertion, \"God did it!\" without any specifics as to how, then you have answered no questions and explained nothing. Such empty assertions cannot be proven wrong. Such an assertion says nothing about the methods used by God, and that is what scientists study. There are lots of scientists, evolutionary biologists among them, who believe in a Creator God.  Science is not a matter of proving something right. Scientific theories are explanations of the processes and mechanisms that account for the facts that have been observed. In science, the facts are the observations. The process of science is a process of testing those theories, again and again. The body of scientific knowledge is composed of tested theories that have NOT been shown to be wrong. The more a theory has been tested, the more secure it is, even to the point that it is no longer doubted by those who are informed about the topic. How many physicists do you think there are that doubt the the earth orbits the sun? Is that a fact? How many nuclear physicists doubt the existence of atoms or electrons?  Why is it that all creationists seem to be so ignorant of science that they think a theory is some sort of wild guess and that if they are \"proven\" they will grow up to be facts? Did it ever occur to any of you that you should actually learn about the topic before you try to instruct others? One thing that is always true of science is that it is predictive - and \"God did it\" offers no predictions.  However, if you wish to assert that ancient mythology is a historical record of the events, you have made assertions that can be checked. For example, if you assert that the creation took place about 6 to 10 thousand years ago, then we can predict that nothing in the entire universe can be older than that. But clearly there are. And we have observed events that happened longer ago than that. For example, SN 1987 A was a supernova that was observed in 1987 within 3 hours of the first light reaching earth. It's distance from earth has been measured by more than one method. It is 170,000 light years away. In other words, SN 1987 A exploded 170,000 years ago. A creationist's answer is to claim that his god created the light already on its way to earth, complete with the history of an explosion that never happened. Ultimately, creationism falls back on an untestable miracle for which there is no evidence.  So if you want to believe in miracles and mythology, great! But if you wish to argue science, then shouldn't you at least learn what it is? If you claim that a theory is wrong shouldn't you at least know what that theory is?  By the way, I am getting the definition of evolution from memory. I have been using it for many years. It was first stated some 70 or 80 years ago. Anyone who has taken a course in evolutionary biology heard a similar definition the first day of class. Any text on evolutionary biology or that has a chapter on evolution will have a similar definition. It is common knowledge - and that's why I ask, if you don't know what evolution is, how do you know that you are opposed to it?", "label": "fact"}

But I still disagree with your conclusion that \"there's nothing about building a life together that requires the participants to be of differing genders.\" As a general proposition, I agree with this. Two individuals can certainly build a life together without any encouragement from the state. However, in a strict legal sense, there certainly are requirements one must fulfill in order to receive the benefits the state wishes to confer. In other words, legislatures have determined not only that they want to foster and encourage an atmosphere conducive for family life, they have determined that the best way to accomplish this is by encouraging the relationship to be between two individuals of the opposite sex.

{"text": "I've examined Hall's papers and they make interesting reading. However, further research, including some undertaken by Hall himself, has informed the debate greatly.  For one thing, many of the experimental results to which Hall originally proposed sub-population hypermutation (your 'hypermutation as a eusocial response') as an explanation have proved inconsistent with that hypothesis. The Amplification Mutation model described above is a much better fit, correctly predicting such details as clonally-related bacteria possessing redundant lac- copies in addition to the lac+ revertant. The articles I've already cited, though they focus on the Cairns system's experimental vulnerabilities as the origin of the recent directed/adaptive mutagenesis misperception, also include Hall's work in their assessment.  Hall himself performed a followup experiment to his work on anomalous rates of trpAB+ dual revertants, acknowledging that a colleague's suggestion, that stochastically-occurring trpA+trpB revertants were growing on waste byproducts secreted by non-growing trpAtrpB+ revertants was probably correct.   In short, though hypermutation of a sub-population does occur sometimes, it is not always an organismic response (eg mutation promoters coincidentally amplified along with useful genes), and the 'successful' mutants do not always, or even mostly, arise from within that subpopulation.   Also, you still seem reluctant to acknowledge the implications of the existence of a physical mechanism for hypermutation under stress. It must itself have evolved somehow - which makes it logically (as well as empirically, as evidenced by my original post in which 4/5ths of the adaptive bacteria exhibited no increased mutation rate) not a prerequisite for evolution. It's just one more adaptation to the environment - in this case, the environment's potential for inducing - though carcinogens or simple uncertainty at the molecular level - genetic change.", "label": "fact"}

Theories start out as hypothesis and are then subject to experimentation and observation. When they fail they are discarded. For instance spontaneous generation was disproved by Pasteur and discarded as a theory.  Evolution which is not a theory ,although it is called one ,has been falsified nine ways to Sunday. Two of Darwin's own falsifications have come to pass and ignored. The Galopagos Finches have proven to interbreed which destoys a great deal of the so called basis of his theory. \"Extinct\" animals and plants are found alive and ignored as evidence against evolution. Theories are made to be challenged but evidence against evolution is suppressed.  Evolutionist had to revive spontaneous generation although it is scientifically impossible because without it atheism is impossible. The atheist must have a story no matter how bizzare to justify his faith . Science suffers because of this.  My theory is that this planet is exactly what Einstein said it was , a place designed by a Supreme Being to be inhabited by people.  The evidence is creation itself.

But there are some relevant verses that speak to the rightness or wrongness of marriage in different situations; most of which refer to moral issues which is something people in this generation don't want to consider at all. For example, here the bible speaks about keeping the marriage BED pure and undefiled.   Hbr 13:4 Marriage {is to be held} in honor among all, and the {marriage} bed {is to be} undefiled; for fornicators and adulterers God will judge.  And here is where God consecrated the relationship (Marriage) between Man and Woman through Adam and Eve. He also gave Man dominion over all the animals of the World at this time.   No where does the bible refer to gay marriage anywhere in the positive sense as the concept was never raised or dreamt of by anyone in the ancient world, homosexuals included. Only in this generation have the morals and values of society become so reprobate that these various unnatural forms of sexual perversions are seen as right and normal.

Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion.  32 Although they know God's righteous decree that those who do such things   deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things but also   approve of those who practice them.

Nothing is de novo; it's always a modfication of something else. Second, a mutation produced a regulator that only allowed the enzyme to be produced if the substrate was available. Again, this was refined by natural selection over time. In the end, the newly-evolved system was irreducibly complex, because all three parts have to be present for the system to work.

Acid Rain which is a side effect of air pollution has polluted more lakes, streams and rivers than direct dumping has and that is a direct result of heavy metals and other toxins being spewed into the atmosphere by industrial smoke stacks. So this reality goes without saying in my opinion.  But environmental pollution is very different than extending the claim to the next level of Global Warming which implies that the worlds atmosphere is now incapable of repairing itself. That is the crux of this argument and if the atmosphere were so polluted that the Earth was unable to repair itself, then the air quality here in NH would be as polluted as it is in China and Russia even though we have no industrial air polluters at all to speak of here. That would be solid evidence that the volume of pollutants in the atmosphere is overwhelming the Earths ability to repair itself. But our air quality is pristine in comparison to any and all third world countries who are the largest polluters due to their lack of having any industrial pollution safeguards in place.

{"text": "Well not to the pro-life league.  Remember the Unborn Victims of Violence Act passed by the senate after laci peterson? or as they call it, conners law?  The UVVA creates a federal law making it a crime to cause harm to a \"child in utero,\" recognizing everything from a zygote to a fetus as an independent \"victim,\" with legal rights distinct from the woman who has been attacked.  \"More than 30 states already have similar laws on the books. In practice, these laws treat the pregnant woman as little more than collateral damage in an attack portrayed to the public as one directed against the fetus.\"  See, this law has nothing to do with prosecuting criminals who attack pregnant woman, it is about turning pregnant women into criminals.  Why do i say that? Lynn M. Paltrow, executive director of National Advocates for Pregnant Women sums it up quite well:  *In 1984, South Carolina's Supreme Court created a state feticide law in a case where a man viciously stabbed his pregnant girlfriend, causing her, among other things, to lose her pregnancy. In 1997, South Carolina used this law against a pregnant woman, Cornelia Whitner, who was charged with failing \"to provide proper medical care for her unborn child.\" Whitner had given birth to a healthy baby who tested positive for an illegal drug. Based on extrapolation of the state feticide law, Ms. Whitner was convicted of criminal child abuse. At sentencing Ms. Whitner begged for drug treatment. The judge responded, \"I think I'll just let her go to jail.\"  *Regina McKnight was an indigent 22-year-old woman with a drug problem. She became pregnant and despite her problems had every hope of carrying her pregnancy to term, but the pregnancy ended in stillbirth. The hospital reacted not by offering her counseling or drug treatment, but rather by helping build a criminal case against her. Eventually she was convicted of murder.  The South Carolina Medical Association and other leading health groups concluded that there was no evidence that McKnight's drug use caused the stillbirth. Moreover, no one in this case, not even the prosecution, believed that McKnight had any intention of harming the fetus or losing the pregnancy. Had McKnight intentionally sought to end her pregnancy by having an illegal third trimester abortion, her sentence would have been two years in jail -- but because of a law similar to the bill President Bush just signed, she is today serving a 12-year sentence.  read more here   another good article on the matter:  Do pregnant woman have rights?  *In 1984, for example, a Nigerian woman pregnant and hospitalized in Chicago was forced to have a C-section. She refused the surgery because she planned to return to Nigeria where she would be unable to access C-sections for future births. The hospital obtained a court order and forced her to undergo the procedure. Hospital staff tied her down with leather wrist and ankle cuffs while she screamed for help.  *Another hospital obtained a court order to force a pregnant woman to undergo a blood transfusion. Doctors \"yelled at and forcibly restrained, overpowered and sedated\" the woman in order to carry out the order.  *In Washington, DC, doctors sought a court order to force Ayesha Madyun to have a C-section. The doctors asserted that the fetus faced a 50-75 percent chance of infection if not delivered surgically. The court, apparently viewing the pregnant woman as having no more rights than a slab of meat, said, \"[a]ll that stood between the Madyun fetus and its independent existence, separate from its mother, was put simply, a doctor's scalpel.\" With that, the court granted the order and the scalpel sliced through Ms. Madyun's flesh, the muscles of her abdominal wall, and her uterus. When the procedure was done, there was no evidence of infection.  *Angela Carder at 27 years old and 25 weeks pregnant became critically ill. She, her family and her attending physicians all agreed on treatment designed to keep her alive for as long as possible. The hospital however called an emergency hearing to determine the rights of the fetus. Despite testimony that a Cesarean section could kill Ms. Carder, the court ordered the surgery because the fetus had independent legal rights. As a result, Ms. Carder not only lost her right to informed consent and bodily integrity; she lost her life. The surgery resulted in the death of both Angela and her fetus.  \"All of these women were denied the right to bodily integrity and physical liberty and their fetuses were granted more rights than any legal person under law.\"  That line just about sums it up.

God diliberately kept information fro them because He knew they would not understand, just like you would deliberately keep information not pertinent to you children because they will not understand.

You know your kids won't understand (and don't yet need to) about sex and child birth, so when your five year old comes up and asks where do babies come from SOME parents (not all, I know I won't, but SOME do) say that the stork brings babies. They put a myth in place of a fact that the children don't need to know. Furthermore, even if God did explain evolution, if the men He explained it to didn't understand. Which they probably wouldn't have seeing as they had no sense of time, biology, genetics, or even basic anatomy (all pertinent to evolution) then they would have transcribed something VERY different. If God told them \"In the beginning I created the Heavens and the Earth in the first billion years, I said let there be light and I caused a tiny powerful ball of matter with an enormous mass to explode and with that came the heavens and the Earth. At first the Earth w\" Lets see primitive man wouldnt have understood 'billion years' 'tiny ball of matter with an enormous mass' 'explode.'

Even if God didn't as you say 'diliberately' (which in my opinion implies malice, but you may use that word in reference to God if you wish to do so) keep the information from us. In the minds of man it could have been simplified enormously to a point of mythological proportions. A modern day example would be the theory of relativity. Have you ever had it explained to you. I have. It is extremely complicated and few people REALLY understand it. Anyway, when my father explained it to me when I was about 16, we talked about it for several hours (literally) and through all his complicated explanations and answers to my questions, my brain pretty much reduced it to \"As you approach the speed of light time slows down compared to things not going that fast. But that does not mean when you slow back down you will not return to their same 'time.' Time IS relative.\" Now I still don't understand how time is relative or how time would slow down as you reach the speed of light, or even how you would return to their same 'time.'

[QUOTE]The concept of equality is a lot easier to conceptualize than to put into practice. We, as a society, preach equality in principle, but practice inequality in all aspects of our lives. As I mentioned above, the tax code is a great example of institutionalized inequality. Businesses practice institutionalized inequality daily. For example, I am considered, by my employer, to be an HCI (highly compensated individual). As a result, I pay a much higher rate for the same healthcare coverage that my fellow employees get. Is that fair? I guess as I get older, I worry less about abstract concepts that sound good in theory but don't exist in practice.[QUOTE]  Well, I won't argue that we will never be truly equal, and I won't argue that equality is the answer to everything, but I will argue that equality is worth striving for and that equality does exist in practice, it is just so ingrained into our mindset that we forget it is there. Compare US law to the laws of Europe before the revolution. In Europe there existed classes of nobles with extra rights under the law as well as kings and royalty with even more rights. As you went higher up in class, you'd get more and more political power. In America, we all have one vote. We all have an equal ability to participate in government. It is true that we use that vote to choose someone to make decisions for us in the government, but our ability to participate in government set a new precedent in equality. Consider even slaves or women's rights. These are cases where equality won out not just in theory but in practice. I will admit that we cannot simply just make everyone equal in every way, but we do our best to give them equal rights and equal represenation. In the case of same-sex marriage, I can think of no reason why we should not extend the same rights that opposite-sex couples have to same-sex couples (and plenty of reasons why we should).", "label": "fact"}

Dr Stanley Jaki has documented how the scientific method was still-born in all cultures apart from the Judeo-Christian culture in Europe (Science and Creation (Edinburgh and London: Scottish Academic Press, 1974)). An orderly universe makes perfect sense if it was made by an orderly Creator. But if there is no creator, or if Zeus and his gang were in charge, why should there be any order at all? Loren Eiseley stated (Loren Eiseley: Darwin's Century: Evolution and the Men who Discovered It, Doubleday, Anchor, New York (1961):  \u00e2\u0080\u0098The philosophy of experimental science\u00e2\u0080\u00a6began its discoveries and made use of its methods in the faith, not the knowledge, that it was dealing with a rational universe controlled by a creator who did not act upon whim nor interfere with the forces He had set in operation\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 It is surely one of the curious paradoxes of history that science, which professionally has little to do with faith, owes its origins to an act of faith that the universe can be rationally interpreted, and that science today is sustained by that assumption.\u00e2\u0080\u0099  C.S. Lewis also pointed out that even our ability to reason would be called into question if atheistic evolution were true (God in the Dock (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 1970) pp. 52-53):  \u00e2\u0080\u0098If the solar system was brought about by an accidental collision, then the appearance of organic life on this planet was also an accident, and the whole evolution of Man was an accident too. If so, then all our thought processes are mere accidents\u00e2\u0080\u0094the accidental by-product of the movement of atoms. And this holds for the materialists and astronomers as well as for anyone else's. But if their thoughts\u00e2\u0080\u0094i.e. of Materialism and Astronomy\u00e2\u0080\u0094are merely accidental by-products, why should we believe them to be true? I see no reason for believing that one accident should be able to give a correct account of all the other accidents.\u00e2\u0080\u0099  Further more, on what basis can we study the world in any coherent way and come to sensible conclusions about it?", "label": "fact"}

SS: Show me one instance of a genetic mistake (random mutation/copying error) that that created a beneficial body part.  What do you mean by 'part'? If you're asking for an example of a single mutation that created an arm or a leg where none existed before, then you're asking for evidence of something that the ToE in no way shape or form says is possible.   ok....I'll save that.  Sickle-cell is a pretty good example, though, if you're prepared to accept blood as a 'body part'.   I'm not....besides, sickle cell adds nothing benefical in the way of phenotype. We've been over this here. Have anything else?  Strictly speaking, accumulation of mutations alone isn't what creates a new species; so long as a species interbreeds well,   well since you can't show me one case of speciation, with backup that the old and the new species can't interbreed and produce viable offspring, we'll just assume that it can't be done at all.  SS: Show me one instance of a mutation that formed a new organ or limb.  Not possible, and not predicted or required by the ToE either, so it's a strawman.  cool, ok...we agree there. Do you think a mutation can create a partial organ or limb?...like say 1/100th of one -- and be selected for?  Pretty much every experiment ever carried out in a petri-dish; take your pick :) Also the revisited peppered moth experiment I linked to earlier.  those are not animals and it's not RMNS....it's simply a fluid, adaptive genome at work.

{"text": "I think reason why the \"hypothesis validated\" card has been played here is because:  1. The time window for the expected transitional form is about ~20 ma, a narrow window by geological timeframes. Given this the researchers examined the stratigraphic column to select locatities where the rocks were of the corresponding age and selected sites accordingly.  2. Tiktaalik was expected to live in a certain type of environment, and this expectation was used to further narrow the localities that would be explored as potential deposits for containing the expected \"transitional\" form.  3. Having selected the locality, expeditions were mounted and successfully recovered remains of the anticipated beastie. Upon analysis it was found to lie in terms of evolutionary development between the most derived/advanced fish and most primitive tetrapods that had been previously known.  Given the huge expanse of the Earth's surface 1 and 2 helped the researchers select comparitively tiny areas to examine and the fact they found what they (roughly) expected to find says their hypothesis (we will find remains of transitional form x at locality y) was borne out. If no remains had been found then further expeditions might have been successful and the hypothesis could of been validiated at a later date. If they had found, lets say a more primitive form than the previously most advanced fish or a more advanced tetrapod than the previously most primitive form then I think that might amount to a falsifiaction.  Having said all that I think that to claim a hypothesis was validated in this instance is slightly confusing as palaeontology is like archeology- you can never be 100% sure everthing has been found and one small discovery can force a rethink of what that had been established up to that point. Also, IIRC, none of the three articles in nature make any reference to a hypothesis being validated ;)  I'd describe it more as being an expectation being fufilled.", "label": "fact"}

{"text": "You guys know me. Always happy to correct anyone.  As electrolyte pointed out, (1) the first step in the scientific method is the observation. A scientist observes something that raises a question. (2) Then comes the hypothesis, that is an attempt to explain the observation. The hypothesis can be an educated guess or even wild speculation based on previous knowledge or intuition, or it may be based in previous science and an understanding of scientific principles. (3) One then makes a prediction that is a necessary consequence of the hypothesis. That science is predictive is one of its salient characteristics. In the case of the scientific method, the prediction is said to have the power to falsify the hypothesis. In other words, if the prediction can be shown to be false, then the hypothesis must also be false. If the prediction is true, then the hypothesis is supported. So now we have the observation, the hypothesis that explains the observation, and a prediction that is a consequence of the hypothesis. The next step (4) is to design an experiment to test the prediction, and then (5) to perform the test. If the prediction fails the test, then it may be abandoned. However, as electrolyte pointed out, the process may be circular, because if the prediction is falsified, additional observation from the test may be used to adjust the hypothesis at (2), and a new prediction is made at (3), and so on.  In creation science, the process stops at (2), except that the hypothesis is based on dogma and scripture, not reality.", "label": "fact"}
{"text": "Well I replied to this same post a couple months ago, but I would like to respond with a new perspective I have on it now.  Basically the basics of the US government is that it is to secure our rights and our safety, so that we don't live in a state of anarchy, where the biggest strongest man wins. If a power isn't given to the government, they may not use it. The bill of rights is an even further prohibition of regulation. To make a law based on firearms or anything they have to have a reason for doing it, and the federal government may not be involved unless the Constitution grants them the right to (it doesn't mention guns in the powers it gives the US government). The 2nd amendment is restricting the government (federal, states, and local governments) from infringing upon that right. But the question still arises, what is meant by the mysterious militia clause?  There are many interpreations on this but I think the basic meaning of this is so that a similar thing could happen as did in the American revolution. But then an even bigger problem arises. If that purpose is to be left intact we need to allow the citizens to access the same weapons the government has. But I really don't feel comfortable allowing citizens with atomic bombs and such. This is really a problem. Also, obviously if this were meant to be a tool for a revolution, wouldn't concealed weapons also be covered? Again it seems that it is currently impossible to follow the intentions of the amendment.  Many will use the quote \"Those that sacrifice liberty for safety deserve neither\", but this is a hollow argument. The whole purpose of government is that we give up some of our natural liberties (the liberty to kill someone) for personal safety and protection of our other rights (the right to life). I agree you cannot go too far, but where do we draw the line? I don't like the idea of an oppressive government owning all the weapons or do I want them available to the worst criminals, so that instead of handguns and regular bombs, they are using uzies and atomic bombs? Do you have more trust in the government or in the general public? That's a hard question to answer because I don't have much trust in either one, therefor I seem to be undecided on where to really draw the line.

Overall, I don't think this author brought up any legitimate point against evolution except for the lack of transition species, which is an interesting topic in itself.  However, if the author had proven that the world is young, the most logical explanation would be that evolution occurred in a shorter span of time, for all of our scientific evidence points toward evolution. If the author had proven that evolution hadn't occurred, then the most logical explanation that some similar, natural process is the cause. But it is a great leap of faith to suggest that Creationism is correct.  See, the author has made a mistake fatal in debate: he has attack his opponent's viewpoint, then stated that since his opponent is wrong, he is correct. But that is not true, for he has not provided any reason for us to believe that he is correct.  I, for example, might be contending that a bunch of Vampires carried stones together to form the Earth, then used their magic powers to make those stones into our world today. I could have then stated exactly all of the things this author stated, only replacing those Biblical quotes with writings about Vampires, and I could have come to the same conclusion.

{"text": "THE ONLY QUESTION ABOUT GUN REGISTRATION  by Alan Korwin  Dear Editor,  Only one thing is overlooked in the common-sense proposals to register guns, so here it is. How exactly would writing down my name, or your name, help arrest criminals or make you safer? Although at first blush, gun listing has a sort of tantalizing appeal, on reflection you have to wonder whether gun lists would be an instrument of crime control at all.  The unfortunate answer is that, no matter how good it feels when the words first pass your ears, registering honest gun owners doesn't stop criminals, and in fact focuses in exactly the opposite direction. It is an allocation of resources that has no chance of achieving its goal, if that goal is the reduction of crime.  1. Registering 70 million American households is extremely expensive.  Do you know what it takes to run a database that big? You need 19,000 changes daily, just to keep up with people who move every ten years. Floor after floor of cubicle after cubicle for employees with permanent jobs, payroll, parking and dry cleaning bills. It's a government jobs program all by itself, all in the common sense -- but deceptive name -- of stopping crime. How many criminals do you figure will register when all is said and done? That's right, none, and the planners know that. All that money and time, invested on tracking the innocent. That's why so many police departments are against it -- they'll be forced to run huge data centers with their limited resources, and hire clerks instead of cops.  2. Americans who fail to register would become felons without committing a crime.  Under registration, activity that is a common practice and has been perfectly legal since inception makes you a felon. Think about that. Possession of private property would subject you to felony arrest, if the property isn't on the government's master list. Boy, that doesn't sound like the American way. No other evil is needed, there is no victim and no inherent criminal act takes place. Paperwork equals prison. That's just wrong.  3. Registration, if enacted, will create an underground market for unregistered guns bigger than the drug trade.  How many times must an elite forbid what the public wants, before learning the unintended consequences of outlawing liberties? People get what they want either way, it's just a question of how much crime the government itself forces to accompany it. With respect to guns, the last thing you want to encourage is the creative import programs and price supports that drug dealers enjoy, for gun runners.  4. People have said to me, \"But Alan, if all guns were registered and there was a crime, then you could tell.\"  Tell what? If your neighbor is shot, that's not probable cause to search everyone with a matching caliber in a ten-block radius. The evidence needed to conclusively link a person to a crime has no connection at all to a registration plan -- you need motive, opportunity, witnesses, physical evidence, the murder weapon. Police aren't waiting for official lists so they can start catching murderers. Gun registration schemes lack a crime prevention component.  5. You don't really think authorities would use gun registration lists to confiscate weapons from people, do you?  Despite real-life examples recently of exactly that in New York, California and Louisiana, and global history for the past century, this couldn't really happen, do you think? Who would even support such a thing in a country like America, with its Bill of Rights? The guarantees against confiscating property, unwarranted seizures and the right to keep and bear arms would surely forestall any such abuse of power. Are there really U.S. politician who would support firearm seizures? (Unfortunately, it's a long list of usual suspects.)  And what about the so-called First Amendment test? If it's OK for arms it must pass muster for words too. Why would an honest writer object to being on the government list of approved writers? Why indeed.  Pile logic on logic, some people just feel the government should register everything, just to keep control. When government has that much control, you no longer possess your liberties. You're living where government lists define who can do what, and where people control trumps crime control -- the gun registration model precisely. This form of \"gun control\" isn't about guns, it's about control.  I might favor registration if the system would include criminals. In fact, I'd favor testing the system on them first. But the U.S. Supreme Court, in a widely known case (Haynes v. U.S., 1968), had determined that a felon who has a gun cannot be compelled to complete such forms, because it violates the Fifth Amendment right against self incrimination. That's right, mandatory registration -- not in your case of course but in the case of a criminal -- is a self-indictment of a crime, and is therefore prohibited.*  Gun listing is a feel-good deception that passes unquestioned by the \"news\" media, engorges the federal or state bureaucracy, and undercuts the linchpins of American freedoms. It has no more place in a free society than a government authorized list of words, and should be rejected outright. Elected officials who promote such a scheme are opposing the very Constitution they take an oath to preserve, protect and defend, and deserve to be removed from office.  Sincerely,  Alan Korwin, Author  Gun Laws of America  * NOTE: This case only concerned a limited class of weapons, \"destructive devices,\" which are listed and tracked in a special federal registry under the National Firearms Act. Congress rewrote that law after Haynes to require only the legal transferor, and not the transferee, of such devices to file papers, and along with other clever changes this overcame the 5th Amendment problem. In U.S. v. Freed, 1971, the Court agreed the problem had been fixed (for possession of hand grenades by criminals in that particular case).  A general registration scheme would run into a greater problem. A prohibited possessor cannot have a firearm at all, so mere possession is a serious crime. An additional charge for failing to register the gun that can't be possessed would offend the 5th Amendment the same as in the Haynes case. However, possession of an unregistered gun by an ordinary citizen would turn that citizen into a felon, with no other illegal act but the paperwork failure. The innocent would have to register to remain legal, the illegal possessor could not register without violating the right to not incriminate yourself.", "label": "fact"}

{"text": "Well, to keep it short, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll cite you to what I think are two of the best expressions of why the RKBA exists. The first was said by an Englishman named Andrew Fletcher, whose work was frequently cited by our founders to justify armed resistance against British misrule in America. The second was said by a Judge in my beloved Commonwealth of Virginia:  And I cannot see, why arms should be denied to any man who is not a slave, since they are the only true badges of liberty. . . .The possession of arms is the distinction between a freeman and a slave. He who has nothing, and belongs to another, must be defended by him, and needs no arms: but he who thinks he is his own master, and has anything he may call his own, ought to have arms to defend himself and what he possesses, or else he lives precariously and at discretion. And though for a while those who have the sword in their power abstain from doing him injury; yet, by degrees, he will be awed into submission to every arbitrary command. Andrew Fletcher, Political Works, pp. 35 and 221 (1749).   The right of self-defense is the first law of nature; in most governments it has been the study of rulers to confine this right within the narrowest possible limits...and [when] the right of the people to keep and bear arms is, under any color or pretext whatsoever, prohibited, liberty, if not already annihilated, is on the brink of destruction. Sir George Tucker, Judge of the Virginia Supreme Court and U.S. District Court of Virginia, in I Blackstone COMMENTARIES, Sir George Tucker Ed., 1803, pg. 300  There are many solid legal, moral, and practical arguments in support of private firearm ownership. Some are short, but many are long. I know quite a few of them, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll happily share them with you if you want some more ammo for your debate. Just let me know here.  ---  False is the idea of utility that sacrifices a thousand real advantages for one imaginary or trifling inconvenience; that would take fire from men because it burns, and water because one may drown in it; that has no remedy for evils, except destruction. The laws that forbid the carrying of arms are laws of such a nature. They disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes. Can it be supposed that those who have the courage to violate the most sacred laws of humanity, the most important of the code, will respect the less important and arbitrary ones, which can be violated with ease and impunity, and which, if strictly obeyed, would put and end to personal liberty--so dear to men, so dear to the enlightened legislator--and subject innocent persons to all the vexations that the guilty alone ought to suffer? Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants; they serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man. They ought to be designated as laws not preventative but fearful of crimes, produced by the tumultuous impression of a few isolated facts, and not by thoughtful consideration of the inconveniences and advantages of a universal decree. Thomas Jefferson, Commonplace Book, 1774-1776, quoting 18th century criminologist Cesare Beccaria in On Crimes and Punishment, 1764  A militia, when properly formed, are in fact the people themselves, and render regular troops in a great measure unnecessary. . . .the constitution ought to secure a genuine and guard against a select militia. . .and include. . .all men capable of bearing arms. . . . But, say gentlemen, the general militia are for the most part employed at home in their private concerns, cannot well be called out, or be depended upon; that we must have a select militia. . . .[of the select militia] These Corps, not much unlike regular troops, well ever produce an inattention to the general militia. . .whereas, to preserve liberty, it is essential that the whole body of the people always possess arms, and be taught alike, especially when young, how to use them. . . .The mind that aims at a select militia, must be influenced by a truly anti-republican principle; and when we see many men disposed to practice upon it, whenever they can prevail, no wonder true republicans are for carefully guarding against it. Richard Henry Lee, Additional Letters from the Federal Farmer, p. 169-170 (1788)  Among the many misdeeds of the British rule in India, history will look upon the Act depriving a whole nation of arms as the blackest. If we want the Arms Act to be repealed, if we want to learn the use of arms, here is a golden opportunity. If the middle class render voluntary help to Government in the hour of its trial, distrust will disappear, and the ban on possessing arms will be withdrawn. Ghandi, 2 M. Gandhi, An Autobiography of the Story of My Experiments with the Truth, p. 374 (M. Desai, trans. 1927).  Whenever, therefore, the profession of arms becomes a distinct order in the state. . .the end of the social compact is defeated. . . .No free government was ever founded, or ever preserved its liberty, without uniting the characters of the citizen and soldier in those destined for defense of the state. . . .Such a well regulated militia, composed of freeholders, citizens and husbandman, who take up arms to preserve their property, as individuals, and their rights as freemen. M. T. Cicero (a pseudonym taken by a writer arguing during the constitutional debates), Charleston State Gazette, September 8, 1788  It has been asserted by the most respectable writers upon government, that a well-regulated militia, composed of the yeomanry of the country, have ever been considered as the bulwark of a free people. Tyrants have never placed any confidence on a militia composed of freemen. John DeWitt, The Anti-Federalist Papers, p. 75 (M. Borden ed. 1965)  Make mass searches and hold executions for found arms. V. I. Lenin, Collected Works, Vol. 35, 4th ed., p. 286. From Congressional Record, April 28, 1970, p. H3601.  If the opposition disarms, well and good. If it refuses to disarm, we shall disarm it ourselves. Joseph Stalin, Reply to the discussion on the Political Reports of the Central Committee, Dec. 7, 1927. Stalin, Works, Vol. 10, p. 378. From Congressional Record, April 28, 1970, p. H3601..  The most foolish mistake we could possibly make would be to allow the subject races to possess arms. History shows that all conquerors who have allowed their subject races to carry arms have prepared their own downfall by so doing. Indeed, I would go so far as to say that the supply of arms to the underdogs is a sine qua non for the overthrow of any sovereignty. So let's not have any native militia or native police. German troops alone will bear the sole responsibility for the maintenance of law and order throughout the occupied Russian territories, and a system of military strong-points must be evolved to cover the entire occupied country.

Barring mutations that cause significant changes over a lot of time, Apes, Chimps, Monkies wouldn't really change all that much. There's no real pressure to do so. They are already well-adapted to their surroundings.  Actually however, there really isn't that much difference between some of the great apes and Humans. Take the Bonobo Chimps, for example.

As long as the truth is taught, that there is really no proof for either abiogenesis or creation, I'm fine.

The problem with gun control laws is that they seldom contain a crime control element. Somebody who is going to rob a liquor store is not likely to stop and rethink their plan because their firearm is illegal. They are getting ready to commit a felony anyway.

Partial-birth abortion is done only in a case when the mother's life is at stake, no, it does not always \"save the mother's life\" in some cases it is done as a prophylaxis against an event in which life-saving measures would be deemed neccessary. Example- the mother has advanced liver disease, when she concieved it seemed as though it would be possible to carry the child, but as her pregnancy advanced, so did her disease, so that now she is in complete renal failure. The doctors advise her that if she continues with her pregnancy, she is putting her own life and that of ther child into jeopardy. He urges her to abort the child, in order to save her life.

{"text": "Well Ladywolf, that is really more of an argument than it is an honest question. If marriage was truly a private affair that impacted nobody outside the couple themselves, then, yes, that question would be valid. But that is a very shallow understanding and a very uninformed understanding of the nature of marriage, because marriage is just as much \u00e2\u0080\u0094 if not more so \u00e2\u0080\u0094 about the community as it is about the couple themselves.   But it's not the community that gets married.  No, it's not the community that gets married, but it's the community that enforces marriage and develops marriage. We need to understand that marriage is just as much a social norm \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a social ideal \u00e2\u0080\u0094 of the kind of behavior that we expect and need for a healthy vibrant society; as much as it is about the emotional commitment of two people.  One of the biggest issues is the social role of marriage. Marriage domesticates men. Men who are not attached permanently to a woman are men that will practice and engage in socially unhealthy behaviors at a much higher level.   How will same-sex marriage effect the concept of \"marriage\"? Marriage becomes reduced down to nothing, because the moral argument for same-sex marriage is the same moral argument for group marriage, for polygamy, and it is going to be impossible to deny polygamous groups \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and group marriage people \u00e2\u0080\u0094 who come forth in all sincerity and say, \"If you can't restrict marriage to only couples of opposite sex, then you can't restrict marriage to only two people.\" They are all very much interwoven.  The three things that you lose are: 1) the domesticating influence of marriage on men; 2) the protective influence of marriage upon women from being victimized and objectified by men; and 3) it provides mothers and fathers for children.   When monogamy is lost as an ideal, the idea that a man should commit himself and forego all other sexual relationships but (the one with) his wife, then women become commodities to be used and collected by men. When committing yourself to a woman and subjugating your sexual desires for the sake of that woman \u00e2\u0080\u0094 when that becomes just one lifestyle choice among many, it is devastating to a culture.

The perspective of the Out of Africa model (often called Out of Africa II, referring to a second migration from Africa of a hominid population) adherents is that when there was a migration of H. erectus out of Africa into Asia and Europe, these populations (seen in materials like the Chinese and Indonesian erectus) did not contribute a significant amount of genetic material to later populations that led to modern humans (some claim no genetic ancestry to these groups and their descendants at all, a \"strict\" replacement model). At approximately 200 kya there was a second migration of hominids out of Africa. This time it was fully modern H. sapiens, which proceeded to replace whatever populations that then occupied Asia and Europe. Some see direct competition and extermination of the native populations, some see passive replacement due to better adaptive strategies, and some see genetic admixture with the preponderance of genetic material coming from the incoming human populations, eventually replacing and assimilating them into the greater collective. In this view there is a specific speciation event that occurred which led to the origin of H. sapiens in Africa, and this population is the forerunner of modern humans, leaving the European Neanderthals, Chinese erectus, and others out in the cold.

However, there is a variety of lung morphologies found in reptiles, including simple sacs in some lizards to the partitioned chambers with intricate support structures in organisms such as monitor lizards and crocodilians. And I am sure that peddler is aware that the crocodilians are the closest living relatives of birds, having arisen from an ancestral archosaur. The dinosaurs, through the ornithodirans, also arose from archosaurs. So the more advanced lung structure may have been ancestral since lizards arose from ancestral diapsids which also gave rise to the archosaurs.  So some birds have a system of (usually) 9 flexible air sacs that that act as bellows to move air through the lungs. Although the air sacs are not directly involved in respiration, they do have other functions, such as thermoregulation and weight reduction. Extensions of these air sacs have invaded the skeleton and form what are called pneumatic bones in birds.  However, there is considerable evidence that this condition occurred in organisms ancestral to birds first. Thus, in the maniraptoriformes it may have been useful in weight reduction in running predators and was retained in birds because the weight reduction was also useful for flight.  But some birds, current and fossil, do not have pneumatic bones. For example, Hesperonis lacked them for obvious reasons. But of course, Hesperonis lacked wings useful for flight.

If you're talking about the origins of life, many evolutionists believe in abiogenesis - that life somehow just came about out of non-life.  Some will say that evolution and abiogenesis are two distinct theories, but there's a lot of cross-over; begun with Charles Darwin himself who postulated a primordial soup.  Miller-Urey did experiments to try to concoct how life began in a primordial soup of their own design. They failed in essence to demonstrate how life could emerge from non-life through natural means. (Many work on the philosophy that life came about and evolved through naturalistic, or materialistic processes)  It leads people such as Nobel-winner Francis Crick to come up with certain strange notions; Panspermia, of which, his version just shifts the problem, rather than answers it. (see below under PANSPERMIA)  Intelligent Design theorists suggest that some intelligence; possibly, but not exclusively a deity is behind nature; that nature seems to have an order. Some here too casually dismiss ID from science but the door's already open to science  SETI looks for ID  Cryptographers do to  Forensic scientists do  THEORIES OF LIFE...  PANSPERMIA  Panspermia is the idea that life came from outer space. As with all theories this too is not homogenous. There's a general panspermia theory, and a 'directed' panspermia theory. The former is a belief that life came here by random chance, such as on a meteor. The later is that life came here at the behest of an intelligence - such as aliens directing ships to earth laden with the molecules of life.  One idea is that the building blocks of life \u00e2\u0080\u009c...Bakes said nitrogenated aromatics exist throughout the Milky Way galaxy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d http://www.spacedaily.com/news/life-04zw.html  \"Francis Crick also thinks that life on earth may have begun when aliens from another planet sent a rocket ship containing spores to seed the earth. This is no idle thought; Crick first proposed it with chemist Leslie Orgel in 1973 in an article entitled \"Directed Panspermia\" in a professional science journal called Icarus. A decade later Crick wrote a book, Life Itself, reiterating the theory; in a 1992 interview in Scientific American on the eve of the publication of his latest book, Crick reaffirmed that he things the theory is reasonable.\" (Behe, M, \"Darwin's Black Box\", p238) which as I said, simply moves the problem to 'where did the aliens come from?'  \"COMPLEXITY THEORY   Stuart Kauffman, a theoretical biologist at the Sante Fe Institute, has put forth the idea that when the necessary elements of the cell formed in the primordial soup (nucleotides, lipids, and amino acids), they were instantaneously integrated into a system, a system which we know as the cell (Cohen, 1996). Kauffman says this was not due to a miracle or chance, but was bound to occur. He rejects other scientists' need to find some sort of genetic carrier like RNA or DNA, or even an aperiodic solid, saying that the life forms may have had no need for them. (An aperiodic solid is one in which the atoms are arranged in some non-repeatable geometric pattern, such as a helix, that would allow for the variation within the structure that is necessary for genetic material). He believes that such genetic carriers could have evolved after the new life was already flourishing. Kauffman has even designed a computer model that shows that when a few organic molecules have developed some catalytic skills and reach the necessary level of diversity, then they spontaneously form an \"autocatalytic set\" (a life form). His theory is based on the general complexity theory, which states that when a system reaches some critical level of complexity, it will naturally produce a degree of complex order (4).\"  http://www.lifesci.utexas.edu/cours...2/JENNIFER.html  A. G. Cairns-Smith's Callisto Theory: That life began from a type of living-clay  Richard Dawkins says of this \"Cairns-Smith believes that the original life on this planet was based on self-replicating inorganic crystals such as silicates. If this is true, organic replicators, and eventually DNA, must later have taken over or usurped the role.\"  http://originoflife.net/cairns_smith/  \"Other Theories  In spite of the intense level of work on the RNA world in the last decade, there is no true consensus theory for precellular life. There are many theories. Here are some of the others ?  A few scientists still say that DNA could succeed in starting life on its way (11). But even the shortest DNA strand needs proteins to help it replicate. This is the chicken-and-egg problem.   There is a \"proteins first\" school. For example, Manfred Eigen of Germany's Max Planck Institute says, \"There is no doubt that proteins, which are more easily formed, were first on the scene\" (11.5). Of course, these first proteins must be much shorter than any used in life today, because of the sheer unlikelihood of forming useful long ones out of a soup of amino acids.   Physicist Freeman Dyson proposes to solve the chicken-and-egg problem with a double origin, one for metabolism (proteins) and one for replication (strands of nucleotides) (12).   In Seven Clues to the Origin of Life (13), A. G. Cairns-Smith says that clay crystals could have served as the scaffolding upon which the first short DNA or RNA genome was constructed. A new elaboration of this idea prompted one writer to wonder, \"Primordial soup or cr\u00c3\u00aapes?\" (14). Even more recently, another tangent on this path leads to zeolite (14.5).   Biologists Harold J. Morowitz (15), David Deamer (16), and others (17), advocate a theory that could be paraphrased as \"containers first.\"   Jeffrey L. Bada of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography holds the minority view that the early Earth was frozen and believes precellular life started in \"cold soup\" under the ice (18, 19).   Chemists Claudia Huber and G\u00c3\u00bcnter W\u00c3\u00a4chtersh\u00c3\u00a4user say the soup where life originated was actually quite hot, probably, near undersea volcanic vents, where iron and nickel sulfides might catalyze some of the necessary reactions (19.5-19.7).   Cornell Astronomer Thomas Gold wonders if life might have originated in a hot environment even deeper, in Earth's crust (19.8).   Stuart Kauffman of the Santa Fe Institute, says, \"...whenever a collection of molecules contains enough different kinds of molecules, a metabolism will crystallize from the broth\" (20).   Another idea is the \"PNA world.\" Because starting the RNA world is so difficult, there probably needs to be a pre-RNA world. PNA, or peptide nucleic acid, might have some of the properties necessary to constitute that world (21). This would be pre-precellular life.\"  http://www.panspermia.org/rnaworld.htm  ADDENDUM  If you're interested in aliens, check out \"The Science of Aliens\" by Clifford A. Pickover.

He found that adaptive genetic mutations arising systematically under these circumstances outnumbered maladaptive and inconsequential mutations to a high degree, statistically speaking.

{"text": "What do you mean \"my ultimate agenda\"? I want regulation of the gun trade as there is regulation of the trade of every product with specific control laws that apply to each product. Does this mean a complete ban? No. Let's compare this to a drivers license. Yes I realize that's not a product, but it is regulated similar to the way guns should be regulated. It varies from state to state, but there is typically a driver's ed class, driving with an instructor, and a driving test. A person must pass all of these things before recieving a license. A person must also meet other qualifications such as vision requirements. Then, in my state, when a person recieves his or her license, it is only a provisional license, meaning that he or she cannot drive between midnight and 5 a.m. This lasts for eighteen months unless there are any moving violations, in which case the period starts over. These are all reasonable restrictions. These ideas can be applied to gun control. There could be gun training and gun tests. Background information such as prior criminal activities should be checked. Guns should not be made available at unregulated events such as gun shows. These sort of regulations are also similar to those on prescription drugs. A person must have a prescription from a real doctor, and he or she can only purchase or pick up the medicine from certified locations.  This is clearly not a fringe view since a large number of people support gun control. You may disagree with this view, but it clearly is not a fringe view. Nor is it a sign of mental instability.  The constitutionality of gun control is clearly debatable. It's not exactly simple. You can't ignore \"well regulate.\" Even GunCite, a pro gun website, says, \" 'To put in good order' is the correct interpretation of well regulated, signifying a well disciplined, trained, and functioning militia.\" Disciplining, training. That sounds like controlling. And if it was such a simple constitutional issue, why hasn't the Supreme Court made a difinitive ruling on it? If anything, it has ruled in favor of gun control, saying in the Miller case that \"The Second Amendment must be interpreted and applied with a view to its purpose of rendering effective the Militia.\" Regardless, the constitutionality of a law does not make it wrong or right.

{"text": "Well that is a problem for the ardent creationist isn't it? Or for any Christian. The Bible says that God cannot lie.   Tts 1:2 In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began;   Num 23:19 God [is] not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent: hath he said, and shall he not do [it]? or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good?   You see the Bible says that God promises never to send a flood to destroy the whole earth again:  Gen 9:15 And I will remember my covenant, which [is] between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.   If the flood were a local flood, as some say, then God is a liar. There have been many local floods througout history. If God is a liar, then the Bible is not the word of God and cannot be trusted.   Consider this excercise in logic:  If God is who he says he is in the Bible, and his very voice created the universe, then can God lie? If light didn't exist, and then God said let there be light and light then existed -- if there is that sort of creative power in the Word of God -- can God lie? Imagine if you had that kind of power in your voice. Whatever you said became true for all eternity. If you contradicted yourself, one reality would be destroyed for another, wouldn't it? If God said \"let there be light, and there was light\" where light had not been before, then what would happen if God were to lie about the earth? Wouldn't the former be destroyed and the new become reality?  In the Bible, Jesus says \"I am the way, the Truth, and the light\". How can someone \"be\" the truth, unless they are a God with the power of creation in their voice. You see, if any part of the Bible is a lie, then the whole idea of God and Jesus comes crumbling down like a house of cards.", "label": "fact"}

Further, natural selection was a proposed mechanism to explain the observed divergence of species.  Darwin was quite aware of the implications of his theory for mankind from the beginning. He was also aware that it would be unpopular with the Church and the religious so he didn't mention it in On the Origin of Species.

{"text": "Nearly all animal phyla* made their first appearance in the fossil record at essentially the same time, an interval of some 5 million years [ET**] (about 525 to 530 million years ago [ET**]) called the \"Cambrian Explosion.\"51  Scientists have found that these early fossils exhibit more anatomical body designs than exist today, and that early animals, the trilobites, had eyes as fully developed as their counterparts today.38  Many of the Cambrian fauna, still survive today, all looking much like they did over 500 million [ET**] years ago. The prominent British evolutionist, Richard Dawkins, comments, \"... [W]e find many of them already in an advanced state of evolution, the very first time they appear. It is as though they were just planted there, without any evolutionary history.\"51  Two places in the world that have an abundance of early (Cambrian) fossils; the Burgess Shale in the Canadian Rockies and the Chengjiang site in China.38  In Stephen J. Gould's popular book, Wonderful Life, he points out that the Burgess Shale Cambrian fossils include \"a range of disparity in anatomical design never again equaled, and not matched today by all the creatures in the world's oceans.\"38   Further, these fossils contain some twenty to thirty kinds of arthropods*** that cannot be placed in any modern group. The modern arthropods, consisting of almost a million species, can all fit into four major groups. But \"one quarry in British Columbia, representing the first explosion of multicellular life, reveals more than twenty additional arthropod designs.\" Today there are about 38 phyla in existence, but the Canadian, Chinese and other Cambrian sites reveal over fifty phyla.38  There has been a decrease in diversity (probably due to global catastrophes). This is the reverse of what evolutionary theory predicts.38  Besides diversity, the Burgess Shale shows exquisite detail, right down to \"the last filament of a trilobite's gill,\" or the last meal in a worm's gut.38  The Chengjiang site has even greater detail, and is earlier. According to Paul Chien, the chairman of the biology department at the University of San Francisco, said the preservation is such that internal organs, nerves, and even the water ducts of jellyfish are observable.38  Researchers found striking similarities between the compound eyes of the Cambrian trilobites and those of modern insects. According to Riccardo Levi-Setti, \"Trilobites could see in their immediate environment with amazingly sophisticated optical devices in the form of large composite eyes. ... The number of individual optical elements in the compound eye could vary from approximately one hundred to more than fifteen thousand in a single eye, a range not very different from that found in modern insects.\"38  The conclusion is that the eye, a complex visual system, was fully formed and functional extremely early in the fossil record. Obviously, this is not predicted by evolutionary theory.38  Until recently, the phylum of vertebrates had been considered a later arrival in evolutionary history. But not now! Even the vertebrate phylum now extends into the Cambrian period, especially with the recent discovery of two fossil fish in China.51  The two new fossils . . . from Chengjiang are the most convincing Early Cambrian vertebrates ever found. The insects and other land invertebrates are also a very important group, and these practically all seem to be living fossils.51  These complex animals were present at the beginning of multicellular life and did not appear later as is predicted by evolutionary theory.38  Evolution does not explain the abrupt appearance of complex forms of life early in the fossil record or these fossils' unequaled diversity. The implication of the Cambrian explosion of diverse, fully functional, and multicellular life is that evolutionary theory is falsified.38  Life did not start out simple and evolve into more complex and diverse animals; it was complex and diverse right at the beginning. This contradiction between the fossil data and the predictions of evolutionary theory falsifies the theory.38  \"The facts of paleontology seem to support creation rather than evolution. All the major groups of invertebrates appear suddenly in the first fossiliferous strata. (Cambrian) of the earth with their distinct specializations, indicating that they were all created at almost the same time.\" - David Enock Associate Professor of Biology.

Only since we've started exporting our ecology, cutting down jungles and so on - only since then have we come into competition with them, to their cost. If we're not careful, the answer to the fatuous question \"If we evolved from chimps, why are there still chimps\" will be \"there aren't\".

David Konig is another historian that has found both the individual rights interpretation and the collective interpretation unsatisfactory.

On neither side of the Atlantic, that is, did the debate concern itself with this right in the present-day sense of an 'individual' or personal constitutional right; but at the same time, its common emphasis on widespread individual arms-bearing for public service distinguishes it from today's narrowly applied 'collective' application to the National Guard. No individual right existed unrelated to service in a well-regulated militia; no effective militia could serve its purpose without an armed citizenry.

How about \"happenstance origins\"? Since you declare that intelligent design is not science, you have to have a criteria for science that intelligent design doesn't fit.

You see, it isn't because religion makes people morally better than atheism. Rather, it would be because churches often organize charitable activities and encourage their members to participate, while atheists, simply have no comparable social structure. It's not that churchgoers have a superior moral sentiment, just that because of their increased social structure they naturally have increased opportunity.  There are countless amounts of people who are atheist that donate from the heart. They do not 'band together' into groups like religions do, and they do not advertise their charitable works like religions do, but they donate from the heart just the same.

{"text": "Another characteristic in this same general area that ties us back to fish is the development of our parathyroid glands - which are very similar to gill buds in fish - from a particular pharyngeal arch: the same one that in fish gives rise to the gill buds!  Moving on to the kidneys for a minute. The human embryo forms not one, but 3 successive kidneys: the pronephric, mesonephric, and metanephric kidneys. Only that last one persists and only it is the kidney you and I and all of our fellow humans use. Why do human embryos go through two transient and simpler kidneys before getting it right? Here's a hint: the other two are carry overs from simpler organisms! The evolutionarily simplest vertebrates, such as hagfish and teleost fish, develop only the pronephric kidney: it is their adult functional kidney. Now move up an evolutionary notch to (other) fish and amphibians. In their embryos, the first kidney still develops, but soon begins to degenerate and is replaced by the mesonephric kidney, which is the functional adult kidney in these organisms. Now move up another evolutionary notch, to reptiles, birds, and mammals. Their embryos form the first kidney, which then degenerates and is replaced by the second kidney, which then degenerates and is replaced by the final, metanephric kidney: their adult functional kidney.  The above is not anywhere near a complete list of embryological evidences for common descent/evolution.  PS: Note the serial addition of developmental stages that occurs in kidneys as one moves up to higher evolutionary levels: \"ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny\". Of course this \"law\" does not hold for all organs/organ systems in all organisms, but it does hold for a few cases.

{"text": "There's just enough truth in that statement to keep me from saying it's false, but if I analyze it, it will help make my point;  The word \"evolution\" has such a broad meaning that it doesn't have to mean atheism, but it since it is practically the only weapon that atheists have to combat the religious worldview, that's what it often DOES mean. If it shouldn't mean it, but it is used so that it does, then that's what it actually means.  Creationism means religion, but it also involves a belief in the authenticity of historical documents that have been meticulously preserved over thousands of years. That's not just religion, it's secular, observed history - something evolution doesn't have.   So if a person hearing your statement doesn't consider it carefully, it's very easy to be mislead by it. It implies that \"evolution\" (the branch that declares that the book of Genesis is false) is somehow a secular, observable truth - while creationism is nothing but a religion, a superstition. Since evolution can't prove the book of Genesis (ancient history) false, and creationism does have some historical backing, they are comparable and they directly conflict.  The problem is, a school teacher can make the statement you made, and it can't be legally questioned by anyone.

{"text": "No, it's not.   The conditions under which evolution operated during the Cambrian/Vendian times were different from the conditions following that time in two main ways, and these differences can potentially account for the origin of the many animal body plans during those early periods and the lack of new ones since.   First, ~540 million years ago most animals were very much simpler (fewer cells, for example) than they are today, so changes to their developmental programs would have been better tolerated. The more complex any system is (the more parts it has, and the more coordinated and well-matched those parts must be, etc.), the more rigidly constrained and less amenable to a given magnitude of change it is. So the simpler developmental processes (simpler adult-form end product, fewer interactions between developmental genes, etc.) of early animals would have allowed for a 'large-scale' change to be incorporated into that animal's ontogeny, though if a change of the same magnitude were to occur today, it would be too disruptive to the complex developmental program and would be eliminated (note that 'large-scale change' refers to the adult form: the actual change that caused that altered end result could be a typical small scale mutation, in an early developmental stage). This it not to propose Goldschmidt's \"hopeful monsters\" that occur due to 'macromutations', but rather an intermediate position between that and the \"only micromutations\" view of gradualistic neo-Darwinism. And, as just mentioned, mutations in developmental processes (even ones that resulted in 'macromutations' in the adult form) would have been more tolerated in the simpler animals that existed ~540 mya than they would be in today's.   Second, ~540 million years ago animal diversity was extremely more limited than it is today, so there was a huge number of open niches: a plentitude the likes of which has never again existed on our planet. An organism that happened to find itself in one of the multitude of open niches (by means of a \"semi-macro\" mutation, the product of a change in a developmental gene) would have faced little if any competition. The reduced external competition would potentially allow the morphological variation(s), that would otherwise likely have been eliminated, to persist. (The sudden change could leave the organism with a lower level of internal coordination: over time, internal coadaptation could evolve to 'catch up' with the change in morphology: these internal adjustments would leave no trace in the fossil record).   Combining these two ideas produces a reasonable explanation of the 'explosion' in new body plans in Vendian/Cambrian times.", "label": "fact"}

It would enable them to discharge the duties of the camp and of the field with mutual intelligence and concert an advantage of peculiar moment in the operations of an army; and it would fit them much sooner to acquire the degree of proficiency in military functions which would be essential to their usefulness.

{"text": "To step in for Duck,  Why would he follow a 74 year old with parkinson's if he weren't the pope? We wouldn't. The whole point is that he is the pope. We look to the pope to be the messenger of Christ and thus an authority on faith and morals. (By the way he's 84  years old and I think he gives a powerful message about the value of life and purpose in the elderly.) So we don't just follow any 74 year old with parkinson's. We follow the one who is the 264th successor of Peter who was appointed by Christ to lead his Church.  But to address your assertion on the bible and abortion:  Nowhere in the Bible is abortion specifically prohibited but the foundation of Christian argument from a biblical perspective is the fact that the unborn being is established as a person from the moment of creation. The unborn being is considered a child. Thus the commandment, \"Thou shalt not kill\" applies. Check out some of these verses as a start: Exodus 21:22-25, Psalm 139:13-16, Psalm 71:6, Deutoronomy 30:19, Luke 1:15 and 1:41, Isaiah 49:1, Jeremiah1:5, 1 Corinthians 6:19-20    It is also of note that it was, in a sense, a curse to be barren in the Jewish/Christian community. Children were thought of as a blessing from God Psalm 127:3-5, Matthew 18:10  (there are many other indications of this as well). An attempt at abortion would go against the prevailing culture and mindset.  The early Church also spoke out against abortion. Look at this link to see excerpts of the Church Fathers on the subject:   http://www.catholic.com/library/Abortion.asp    Keep in mind that not all Christian practices and beliefs are explicity spelled out in scripture.  In discussing abortion in the light of Christianity (including scripture), there are some essentials that must be noticed. The Bible unequivocally \"tells\" us that abortion is wrong and in stark contrast to the Christian message. It does that in the nativity of the Gospel of Luke and it does that in the Passion narratives of the four Gospels. The Christian story is about birth, creation, joy, and perseverance. It is also about sacrifice for others and giving life.   Father Frank Pavone illustrates this by describing a remarkable contrast in thought on abortion between abortion supporters and Christ.   Abortion supporters say, \"This is my body, I can do with it what I want. I can destroy others to preserve my life. I can destroy others so that I may live as I want. Do not interfere with me.\"  Whereas, Christ says, \"This is my body, which is given up for you.\"   \"This is my body\"--same words but much different in intent, in action, in charity, in love, in faith, in hope... Jesus gives his body away so that others live. Abortion proponents cling to their own bodies so that others die.", "label": "fact"}

{"text": "**  The war against war metaphorsThe age-old practice may harm both science and scientists  [Published 16th February 2007 03:05 PM GMT]  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Last month, when the University of Nottingham in the UK opened its new Centre for Healthcare Associated Infections, a facility dedicated to studying and controlling \"superbugs,\" The Guardian newspaper interviewed its director, Richard James, about why such a research center was necessary. He said:   \"This is a sophisticated army with astonishing weapons. And each time we develop something new, [bacteria] develop a defense for it.\"   The use of such war metaphors in science and medicine is not new. As early as 1934, the British Medical Journal wrote about the \"War Against Cancer,\" a phrase we still often hear. But today, militaristic language pops up in almost every scientific domain: conservation biology (\"invasive species,\" \"biosecurity\"); global warming (\"global war on global warming\"); and biomedicine (\"killer cells,\" \"hitting multiple targets\"). The attraction to such language is understandable, as it draws attention, and perhaps even funding (who can forget US President Richard Nixon's declaration to \"conquer\" cancer in his 1971 state of the union address, since which hundreds of billions of dollars have poured into cancer research?). Still, some scientists worry that the use of war metaphors has negative effects on both science and the scientists who adopt the language.   For instance, scientists who use military terms may risk losing credibility, warned Erik von Elm, an epidemiologist at the University of Berne in Switzerland and co-author of a recent Lancet correspondence on military metaphors. \"One of the features of science should be to be objective,\" but war metaphors are precisely the opposite, he noted. \"These terms have an intention, they are sort of modern propaganda.\" Indeed, when Nottingham's James referred publicly to the coming \"post-antibiotic apocalypse,\" the UK's Chief Nursing Officer accused him of sensationalism and scaremongering.   Scientists who frame problems in a militaristic manner also likely have a drastically limited perception of the problem and how to tackle it, noted Berkeley cognitive linguist George Lakoff. \"This is not language, this is the way people think.\" In microbiology, for instance, scientists often frame viruses and bacteria as the enemy, and may focus on destroying them and be blind to alternatives, said Brigitte Nerlich, professor of science, language and society at the University of Nottingham. With bacteria like methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), however, \"You have to look at multiple factors, and not just in terms of attack and defend,\" she said. Indeed, some argue that our militaristic use of antimicrobial agents has, by introducing new selection pressures, only made pathogens stronger, while a consideration of other factors -- like host behavior and the social and physical environment -- could offer better solutions.   Brendon Larson, assistant professor of environment and resources studies at the University of Waterloo in Canada, argued the same of \"invasion biology,\" where scientists may automatically assume an invading species must be removed. But in some cases, a sustainable relationship makes more sense -- for example, removal of the \"invading\" Himalayan blackberry from parts of California hurt the native tricolored blackbird, which used the plants as nesting habitats. \"We're entrenched in a particular way of seeing this situation, that [invasive species are] enemies, they're bad and we have to get rid of them,\" Larson told The Scientist. Indeed, according to Larson, the modern use of military terminology may have contributed to US President George W. Bush's decision to merge part of the government agency responsible for invasive species into the Department of Homeland Security.   Still, scientists are not likely to move beyond the adversarial metaphor anytime soon, said Columbia University's Barron Lerner, author of The Breast Cancer Wars: Hope, Fear and the Pursuit of a Cure in Twentieth-Century America. \"They're here to stay,\" Lerner said, admitting that when he was writing about the prevalence of such metaphors, he unknowingly began using them himself. Remembering, as writer Susan Sontag advised, that war metaphors in medicine can be misleading, and remaining aware of metaphors' effect on science, is the best scientists can do, Lerner noted.

{"text": "But Mexicans and Native Americans are the same species, so it's not just like that. This butterfly is a species different than either parent.  One reason that that particular creationist objection has no merit is because the butterflies are significantly biologically different (i.e. different species). The fact that we call each species a type of butterfly has only to do with our taxonomic system.  If we were to somehow have fossils representing the complete record of the water-to-land transition, one would be forced to pick a point at which a fish became a land animal. Just because one finds this a difficult task to accomplish doesn't mean that there was no transition. Likewise, this applies to any line of ancestry.  As an example, look at creationists' response to Archaeopteryx. Many insisted that it is a bird. Others insisted that it is a reptile. A few have originally called it a bird, then decided that it must be a reptile. The fact that people have trouble fitting an organism into our previously-learned concepts of classifications is a sign that species have changed significantly.", "label": "fact"}

{"text": "But here I slam into my own brick wall, one which neatly intersects my path down your chain of reasoning. Biological systems are simply orders of magnitude more complex than any other chemical processes because they are , by definition, autocatalytic-with-errors systems, which is a giant leap in terms of potential, in terms of the variety of future system-states that can be generated. But it is still possible to model these system-state trajectories in terms of probability, which is where chaos theory and emergence come in.  To bring myself to a close, I return to my original point. The concept 'emergence' is a human-imposed concept that can be easily described, if you so wish, as new information arising in a system ex nihilo. But it is equally easily (and more precisely) described as a rearrangent of a system's information in a way that is specifically unpredictable. That is what emergence is. There is no 'energy' created ex nihilo. There is no 'matter' created ex nihilo. The only thing that seems to be created ex nihilo is that sudden realisation within the human mind that the patterns of information have drastically changed in a way that redefines the entire system. This is why maths is essential, because the maths shows that the system has merely been reorganised, albeit radically.  It is such radical restructuring of information that I suspect gives rise to apparent consciousness. As I have said before, I do not deny consciousness, and I do prefer to think that it is real. But I do not assume that it is anything but apparent when I am making analytical judgements, and I cannot begin to imagine how you come to the conclusion that organisms such as bacteria possess it when they specifically, are quite obviously and evidently, no more than fiendishly complex micromachinery. With mammals it's another story.", "label": "fact"}

Besides, a selected variation does not mean that it will bode for the best. That is WW's interpretation and value judgment ... in hindsight ... a variation of the view .. twas God's will, He knew what he was doing ... but all you have definitively established is that you yourself looked to the past and infered intent as to the future based on your selective perceptions about what was going on and what feels good.

{"text": "Oh, well I'm not saying that companies won't be paying more money in health insurance. My point is that allowing same-sex marriage doesn't really change company policy. The company's policy is currently based on the government's definition of marriage. If the government simply allows more people to choose to classify themselves as married, the company may see more more married couples apply for jobs, and it may see more of its employees decide to become married. As it sees these things happening, it can feel free to change its policies as it sees fit. What I mean is that this ruling would not mandate the businesses to make any payments to facillitate a change; all that would happen is a few more of its employees might begin to classify themselves as married and it might be a bit more likely that the company hires in a married person. There is no mandate sent out to the company, there is no change in company policy, and there is no payment that the company is dishing out. If as more married people show up in the workplace, the company decides to change its health care coverage, that is up to the company, but it is not mandated to make any change.  Now maybe you can still classify this as an unfunded mandate, but I'm not really so sure that it legally qualifies under the circumstances. Regardless, I've been saying that its status as an unfunded mandate is irrelevant in determining whether it is right to agree with same-sex marriage or not; the fact that companies might have to provide all couples with health care equally instead of only giving health care to couples based on the sex of those involved is a change worth making. Quite a few companies already do it, in fact.", "label": "fact"}

No, all the evidence that we have in favour is the red shift of starlight and the background microwave radiation (which is all at the same temperature, give or take a few K). We all know how evolutionists interpret the evidence, but the evidence makes just as much more sense when interpreted through Dr Humphreys' new young earth relativistic cosmology model. This is outlined in his book \"Starlight and Time\" and is an amazing read. So the same evidence (e.g. redshift, CBM radiation) makes sense in both models (although CBM causes a little trouble in the big bang theory).   But we have no human eye witness accounts of the big bang or even creation unfolding. Nor we can observe life coming from lifeless chemicals, nor we can observe life going from simple to complex - today we observe mutations and natural selection going in the opposite direction. Basically, no one was there to see the supposed evolution of all things. We have no eye witness accounts of any of these events, they certainly cannot be repeated or experimented upon today.

Luke 11: 21 When the strong one, having been armed, guards his dwelling, his goods are in peace. 22 But as soon as one stronger than he comes, he overcomes him; he takes away his armor on which he relied, and deals out his arms.   \"a moments notice...\" Well it appears the guaranteed scheduled time is on the day of judgment.

Davidson  John Nevin Andrews Professor of Old Testament Interpretation  Old Testament Department  Andrews University, Berrien Springs, Michigan  Origins 22(2):58-73 (1995).   WHAT THIS ARTICLE IS ABOUT  The extent of the Genesis Flood has been vigorously debated by biblical scholars. For those who accept a recent creation week of six literal consecutive, twenty-four-days, a universal Flood is necessary to explain the existence of the geologic column. The thesis of this study is that only the traditional interpretation which posits a literal, universal, world-wide Genesis Flood does full justice to all the relevant biblical data. The author summarizes twenty-two lines of biblical evidence \u00e2\u0080\u0094 including terminological, thematic, contextual, grammatical-syntactical, literary-structural, logical-conceptual, theological, canonical, and typological which support the universality of the Genesis Flood.  PLEASE NOTE: Unfortunately, we are unable to reproduce all of the special accent marks that were present in our printed version of the Hebrew transliteration. Our apologies for any inconvenience this might cause.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  I. Conflicting Schools of Interpretation  One of the most controversial aspects of the Flood narrative concerns the extent of the Genesis Flood. Three major positions are taken: (1) the traditional, which asserts the universal, world-wide, nature of the Deluge; (2) limited or local flood theories, which narrow the scope of the Flood story to a particular geographical location in Mesopotamia; and (3) non-literal (symbolic) interpretation, which suggests that the Flood story is a non-historical account written to teach theological truth.  Against this third position, the non-historical, we must note the evidences within the biblical account affirming the historical nature of the Flood. In the literary structure of the Flood story (see Shea 1979), the genealogical frame or envelope construction (Genesis 5:32 and 9:28-29) plus the secondary genealogies (Genesis 6:9-10 and 9:18-19) are indicators that the account is intended to be factual history. The use of the genealogical term t\u00c3\u00b4led\u00c3\u00b4t (\"generations,\" \"account\") in the Flood story (6:9) as throughout Genesis (13 times, structuring the whole book), indicates that the author intended this story to be as historically veracious as the rest of Genesis (Doukhan 1978, p 167-220). Walter Kaiser analyzes the literary form of Genesis 1-11 and concludes that this whole section of Genesis must be taken as \"historical narrative prose\" (Kaiser 1970).  A number of references in the book of Job may allude to the then-relatively-recent Flood (Job 9:5-8; 12:14-15; 14:11-12; 22:15-17; 26:10-14; 28:9; 38:8-11; see Morris 1988, p 26-30). The historical occurrence of the Flood is part of the saving/judging acts of God, and its historicity is assumed and essential to the theological arguments of later biblical writers employing Flood typology (see Davidson 1981, p 326-327); more on this point later.  Thus according to the biblical writers, far from being a non-historical, symbolical, or mythical account written only to teach theological truths, the Flood narrative is intended to accurately record a real, literal, historical event.  For evangelical Christians who take seriously the biblical record and accept the historicity of the Flood account, the question still remains whether the event described is to be taken as a local, limited flood or a universal, world-wide cataclysm.  The limited flood theories rest primarily on scientific arguments that present seemingly difficult geological, biological, and anthropological problems for a universal flood. (See Boardman 1990, p 212-223; Custance 1979, p 28-58; Kidner 1967, p 93-95; Mitchell 1982/1993; Ramm 1954, p 232-249; Young 1977, p 171-210). Since the scientific argumentation is not the subject of this article, I can only suggest that these problems are not insurmountable, although much more study is needed. A number of studies provides a growing body of evidence for diluvial catastrophism as an alternative to conventional long-age geology (see Coffin and Brown 1983; Roth 1985, 1986a, 1988; Whitcomb 1988; Baumgardner 1994a,b).  The local flood theories further assert that the terminology describing the extent of the Flood should be interpreted in a relative and not absolute universal sense. The various seemingly universal terms are regarded as implying only a limited locality; they are seen to indicate universality within the writer's world-view but a limited scope in terms of our modern world view. (See Boardman 1990, p 223-226; Custance 1979, p 15-27; Kidner 1967, p 93-95; Ramm 1954, p 241-242.) We will take up this issue in the next section of this article.  The traditional conservative understanding of the Flood narrative is that Genesis 6-9 describes a universal, world-wide Deluge. It should be noted that this is also the view of the majority of liberal-critical commentators on Genesis 6-9, although they regard the biblical view as borrowed from the ANE accounts and not historical. (See Hasel 1975, p 78 and Note 16 for bibliography of representatives of this position: Fohrer, Koehler, Noth, Procksch, Skinner, Sarna, Speiser, von Rad, Vriezen, Zimmerli, etc. Some of these and other more recent representatives of this view are cited later in this article.)  The thesis of this article is that only the traditional position of a literal, universal world-wide Flood does full justice to the biblical data, and this universal interpretation is crucial for Flood theology in Genesis and for the theological implications drawn by later biblical writers.  II. Biblical Terminology in Genesis 6-9 Indicating Universality  Perhaps the most important kind of biblical evidence for a universal Flood is the specific all-inclusive terminology found within the Genesis account itself. The late Gerhard Hasel has provided a careful treatment of this terminology in three penetrating studies in previous issues of Origins (Hasel 1974, 1975, 1978), and therefore I need not go into detail in this article. Eight different terms or phrases in Genesis 6-9, most echoing their counterparts in the world-wide creation account of Genesis 1-2, indicate universality.  First, the term ha\u00c3\u0089ares \"the earth,\" occurring 46 times in the Flood narrative (Genesis 6:12, 13, 17, etc.), always without any accompanying genitive of limitation, clearly parallels the usage of the same term in the account of world-wide, universal creation in Genesis 1:1, 2, 10. (While the term at times elsewhere may be used without a genitive and still in context be limited in scope to a certain \"land,\" the explicit link to creation in the Flood account (see especially Genesis 6:6, 7) clearly gives a universal context for its usage in Genesis 6-9.)  Some have argued that if Moses had wished to indicate the entire world, he would have used the Hebrew term tebel, which means the world as a whole, or dry land in the sense of continents. This word is never used in the Flood narrative. But it should be pointed out that tebel is never used in the entire Pentateuch, including the creation account. In fact, the term appears no where in the narrative portions of the Hebrew Bible, but only in poetic texts (39 times) usually as a poetic synonym in parallel with ha\u00c3\u0089ares \"the earth.\" Thus this argument from silence does not adequately consider the contextual and poetic use of terminology, and carries little weight.  A second expression, \"upon the face of all the earth\" \u00c3\u008cal-pen\u00c3\u00aa kol-ha\u00c3\u0089ares (Genesis 7:3; 8:9), clearly alludes to the first occurrence of the same phrase in the universal context of creation (Genesis 1:29; cf. Genesis 1:2 for a related universal expression), and thus here also implies a universality of the same dimension, i.e., the entire surface of the global mass. While the shortened term \"all the earth\" (kol-ha\u00c3\u0089ares) by itself may have a limited meaning elsewhere when indicated by the immediate context (see Exodus 10:5, 15; Numbers 22:5, 11; 1 Kings 4:34; 10:24; 2 Chronicles 36:23; Genesis 41:57), the immediate context of the Flood story is the universal sinfulness of humankind whom God had made and created (Genesis 6:6,7) to have dominion over \"all the earth\" (Genesis 1:26), and the succeeding context is the universal dispersal of man after the Tower of Babel \"upon the face of all the earth\" (Genesis 11:4, 8, 9). In each of the four occurrences of the phrase \"upon the face of all the earth\" in Genesis outside the Flood story (Genesis 1:29; 11:4, 8, 9), it clearly has the universal sense of the entire land surface of the globe, and there is nothing in the Flood narrative to indicate any less universality. (It should be also noted that the one place in Genesis where in context a similar phrase \"upon all the face of the earth\" is not universal [the famine mentioned in Genesis 41:56], the Hebrew has a change in word order from elsewhere in Genesis [\u00c3\u008cal-kol pen\u00c3\u00aa ha\u00c3\u0089ares]).  Third, the phrase \"face of the ground\" pen\u00c3\u00aa ha\u00c3\u0089adamah (five times in the Flood narrative, 7:4, 22, 23; 8:8, 13), occurs in parallel with universal terms we have just noted, \"the earth\" (7:23) and \"face of all the earth\" (8:9); and this phrase \"face of the ground\" likewise harks back to its first usage in the universal context of creation (Genesis 2:6).  Fourth, the term kol-basar \"all flesh\" occurs 12 times in Genesis 6-9 (Genesis 6:12, 13, 17, 19; 7:16, 21; 8:17; 9:11, 15, 16, 17). The word kol \"all\" (which can occasionally express less than totality if the context demands), before an indeterminate noun with no article or possessive suffix, as here in Genesis 6-9, indicates totality. God's announcement to destroy \"all flesh\" (Genesis 6:13, 17) and the narrator's comment that \"all flesh\" died (Genesis 7:21-22), except the inhabitants of the ark, indicates universal destruction. The one occurrence of kol plus the determinate noun ha basar \"all the flesh\" (in Genesis 7:15) likewise indicates totality as well as unity.  Fifth, the expression \"every living thing\" (kol-hahay) of all flesh (Genesis 6:19), is another expression of totality; in 7:4, 23, the similar term kol-hayeq\u00c3\u00bbm means literally, \"all existence.\" This term is given further universal dimensions by the addition of the clause harking back to creation \u00e2\u0080\u0094 \"all existence that I have made\" (7:4) \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and by the exclusive statement \"Only Noah and those who were with him in the ark remained alive\" (7:23). As Hasel puts it:  There is hardly any stronger way in Hebrew to emphasize total destruction of 'all existence' of human and animal life on earth than the way it has been expressed. The writer of the Genesis Flood story employed terminology, formulae, and syntactical structures of the type that could not be more emphatic and explicit in expressing his concept of a universal, world-wide flood (Hasel 1975, p 86).  Sixth, the phrase \"under the whole heaven\" (tahat kol-ha\u00c5\u00a1\u00c5\u00a1amayim, Genesis 7:19), is used six times in the OT outside of the Flood narrative, and always with a universal meaning (see Deuteronomy 2:25; 4:19; Job 28:24; 37:3; 41:11; Daniel 9:12). For example, the phrase is used to describe God's omniscience: \"For He looks to the ends of the earth and sees under the whole heavens\" (Job 28:24). Again, it depicts God's sovereignty: \"Whatsoever is under the whole heaven is mine\" (Job 41:11 KJV). (Note that the usage in Deuteronomy 2:25, describing \"the nations under the whole heaven,\" is further qualified and limited by the phrase \"who shall hear the report of you,\" and thus is potentially universal and not an exception to the universal sense.)  The universal phrase \"under the whole heaven\" or \"under all the heavens\" also universalizes the phrase \"under heaven\" (Genesis 6:17) in this same Flood context. The word \"heaven\" alone can have a local meaning [e.g., 1 Kings 18:45], but here the context is clearly universal. Ecclesiastes, which contains numerous allusions to creation, likewise utilizes the term \"under heaven\" with a universal intention (Ecclesiastes 1:13; 2:3; 3:1; cf. the parallel universal expression \"under the sun\" in Ecclesiastes 1:3, 9; 2:11, 17; etc.).  In the Flood account this phrase \"under the whole heaven\" is part of two forceful verses describing the extent of the Flood: \"and the waters prevailed so mightily upon the earth that all the high mountains under the whole heaven were covered. The waters prevailed fifteen cubits upward, and the mountains were covered\" (7:19, 20). Critical scholar John Skinner notes that 7:19, 20 \"not only asserts its [the flood's] universality, but so to speak proves it, by giving the exact height of the waters above the highest mountains\" (Skinner 1930/1956, p 165).  The biblical language here simply cannot be explained in terms of a local sky, and certainly cannot refer to the local mountains being covered by snow, as some proponents of a local flood suggest. H.C. Leupold points out that the writer of vs. 19 is not content with a single use of kol (\"all\") in \"all the high mountains,\" but \"since 'all' is known to be used in a relative sense, the writer removes all possible ambiguity by adding the phrase 'under all the heavens.' A double 'all' (kol) cannot allow for so relative a sense. It almost constitutes a Hebrew superlative. So we believe that the text disposes of the question of the universality of the Flood\" (Leupold 1942, p 301-302).  Seventh, Hasel devoted an entire scholarly article to the phrase \"all the fountains [ma\u00c3\u008cyenoth] of the Great Deep [teh\u00c3\u00b4m rabbah]\" (Genesis 7:11; 8:2), and showed how it is linked with the universal \"Deep\" (teh\u00c3\u00b4m) or world-ocean in Genesis 1:2 (cf. Psalm 104:6: \"Thou didst cover it [the earth] with deep [teh\u00c3\u00b4m] as with a garment; the waters were standing above the mountains\"). The \"breaking up\" and \"bursting forth\" (i.e., geological faulting) of not just one subterranean water spring in Mesopotamia, but of all the \"fountains\" of the Great Deep, coupled in the same verse with the opening of the windows of the heavens, far transcends a local scene. Hasel perceptively concludes that \"the bursting forth of the waters from the fountains of the 'great deep' refers to the splitting open of springs of subterranean waters with such might and force that together with the torrential downpouring of waters stored in the atmospheric heavens a worldwide flood comes about\" (Hasel 1974, p 71).  Eighth, in another article, Hasel (1978) shows how the Hebrew Bible reserved a special term mabb\u00c3\u00bbl which in its 13 occurrences refers exclusively to the universal Genesis Flood (12 occurrences in Genesis, once in Psalm 29: 10). This word may be derived from the Hebrew root ybl \"to flow, to stream.\" The term mabb\u00c3\u00bbl, which in the Flood narrative is usually associated with mayim \"waters,\" seems to have become \"a technical term for waters flowing or streaming forth and as such designates the flood (deluge) being caused by waters. ... mabb\u00c3\u00bbl is in the Old Testament a term consistently employed for the flood (deluge) which was caused by torrential rains and the bursting forth of subterranean waters\" (Hasel 1978, p 92-93). This technical term clearly sets the Genesis Deluge apart from all local floods, and is utilized in the Psalm 29:10 to illustrate Yahweh's universal sovereignty over the world at the time of the Noahic Flood: \"The Lord sat enthroned at the Flood, and the Lord sits as King forever.\"  Summarizing regarding the technical terminology used for the extent of the Flood in Genesis 6-9, Hasel writes:   The Genesis flood narrative provides ample evidence of being an account which is to be understood as a historical narrative in prose style. It expects to be taken literally. There is a consistent and overwhelming amount of terminology and formulae ... which on the basis of context and syntax has uniformly indicated that the flood story wants to be understood in a universal sense: the waters destroyed all human and animal plus bird life on the entire land mass of the globe. To read it otherwise means to force a meaning on the carefully written and specific syntactical constructions of the original language which the text itself rejects (Hasel 1975, p 87).  III. Other Biblical Evidence for a Universal Flood  Many additional lines of biblical evidence converge in affirming the universal extent of the Flood and also reveal the theological significance of this conclusion. We will summarize fourteen points that emerge from the biblical text.  First, the trajectory of major themes in Genesis 1-11 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Creation, Fall, plan of redemption, spread of sin \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is universal in scope and calls for a corresponding universal judgment. We have already noted in reference to specific Flood terminology the numerous allusions to the universal context of creation. The creation of \"the heavens and the earth\" certainly is not local in scope according to Genesis 1-2.  Likewise, the Fall of humanity in Adam and Eve led to the sinful condition of the entire human race (ha\u00c3\u0089dam), not just the inhabitants of Mesopotamia (see Genesis 6:5, 11; Romans 3:19; 5:12). Again, the Protoevangelium (first Gospel promise) outlined in Genesis 3:15, involves the universal moral struggle between the spiritual descendants (or \"seed\") of the serpent and the spiritual descendants (\"seed\") of the woman, culminating in the victory of the representative Messianic Seed over the serpent (see Robertson 1980). This plan of redemption is certainly universal in scope.  In a similar way, the sinful condition of humankind described at the time of the Flood includes more than those living in the Fertile Crescent. From God's perspective, not simply from the culturally conditioned local view of the narrator, we have the results of the divine investigative judgment: \"And God saw that the wickedness of man (ha\u00c3\u0089dam, humankind) was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually\" (Genesis 6:5). Such universal sinfulness naturally calls for universal judgment.  Second, the divine purpose given for the bringing of the Flood makes explicit its universal scope: \"And the Lord said, 'I will destroy man [(ha\u00c3\u0089dam), humanity] whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, creeping things and birds of the air, for I am sorry that I have made them\" (Genesis 6:7). Nothing less than a complete destruction of the human race (except for Noah, 6:8) seems envisaged. Given the length of time from creation (over 1650 years minimum), the longevity of the antediluvians (nearly a thousand years), and God's command at creation to \"fill the earth\" (Genesis 1:28), it is highly unlikely that the pre-Flood population would have stayed only in Mesopotamia. Thus the destruction of humanity would necessitate more than a local Flood.  Third, the genealogical lines from both Adam (Genesis 4:17-26; 5:1-31) and Noah (Genesis 10:1-32; 11:1-9) are exclusive in nature, indicating that as Adam was father of all pre-Flood humanity, so Noah was father of all post-Flood humanity. From the descendants of Noah \"the nations spread abroad on the earth after the flood\" (Genesis 10: 32), and the Tower of Babel experience spreads humanity across the globe (Genesis 11:1-19).  Striking extra-biblical evidence that all human races, and not just the nations of the Fertile Crescent, are included in the descendants of Noah, and retain memory of the universal Flood, is found in the amazing prevalence of ancient flood stories throughout the world. Over 230 different flood stories are known and occur among the most diverse peoples of the earth (see Frazer 1918, 1:105-361; Nelson 1931). A world-wide flood is by far the most frequently-given cause for past universally destructive calamities in the folk literature of antiquity (Thompson 1955, 1:182-194).  A remarkable number of these oral and written traditions agree upon the basic points of the biblical account: all humankind was destroyed by a great flood as a result of divine judgment against human sin, and a single man and his family or a few friends survived the deluge in a ship or other sea-faring vessel. The stories nearest to the area of the Dispersion at Babel are the closest in detail to the biblical account (see Heidel 1946, Jacobsen 1981, and Lambert and Millard 1969). This vast body of ancient witnesses to a world-wide Deluge is powerful testimony to the historicity and universality of the biblical Flood.  Fourth, the same inclusive divine blessing to be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth is given to both Adam and Noah (Genesis 1:28; 9:1). This is another linkage between universal creation and the flood, between the original beginning and the \"new beginning.\" As the human race at creation flows from Adam and Eve, so the postdiluvial humanity is populated through Noah.  Fifth, the covenant (Genesis 9:9-10) with its rainbow sign (Genesis 9:12-17) is clearly linked to the extent of the Flood, and includes the whole earth (Genesis 9:13-17). If there was only a local flood, then the covenant would be only a limited covenant, and the rainbow sign of \"the all-embracing universality of the Divine mercy\" (Delitzsch 1888/1976, 1:289-290) would be stripped of its meaning.  Sixth, the viability of God's promise (Genesis 9:15; cf. Isaiah 54:9) and the integrity of God in keeping His promise is wrapped up in the world-wide extent of the Flood. This point cannot be underscored too heavily: if Genesis 6-9 describes only a local flood, then God has broken His promise every time another local flood has happened! The only way God's promise not to send another flood to destroy every living thing (Genesis 8:21) can be seen to have been kept is if the Flood was a universal one and the whole human race outside the ark was destroyed.  Seventh, the universality of the Flood is underscored by the enormous size of the ark detailed in Genesis 6:14-15 and the stated necessity for saving all the kinds of animals and plants in the ark (Genesis 6:16-21; 7:2-3). A massive ark filled with representatives of all non-aquatic animal/plant kinds would be unnecessary if this were only a local flood, for these kinds could have been preserved elsewhere in the world. Yet the divine insistence in the biblical record is that the animals were brought into the ark to preserve representatives of all of the various kinds (Genesis 6:19-20).  As a matter of fact, if only a local flood were in view, the building of any ark at all, even for Noah and his family, would have been superfluous \u00e2\u0080\u0094 God could simply have warned Noah and his family in time to escape from the coming judgment, just as he did with Lot in Sodom. But the point of the narrative concerning the ark is that there was no other escape; in the midst of the Flood \"only Noah and those who were with him in the ark remained\" (Genesis 7:23).  Eighth, the covering of \"all the high mountains\" by at least 15 cubits (Genesis 7:19-20) could not involve simply a local flood, since water seeks its own level across the surface of the globe. Even one high mountain covered in a local Mesopotamian setting would require that same height of water everywhere on the planet's surface.  In this connection we note that it is not necessary to postulate the existence of mountains as high as Mt. Everest at the time of the Flood, and thus to require waters covering the earth to a depth of six miles, as some proponents of a local flood suggest would be necessary (see Ramm 1954, p 242). The antediluvian mountains were very possibly much lower than at present. Passages in the book of Job and Psalms may well be referring to the process of postdiluvian mountain uplift (see Job 9:5; 28:9; and Psalm 104:7-8).  Also in this connection we may address the objection that proponents of a local flood often raise, namely, that a world-wide Flood would imply \"that the earth's surface was completely renovated during the flood year\" and thus \"prediluvian topography would have been exceedingly different from postdiluvian topography.\" This implication, they claim, is in conflict with biblical evidence which \"strongly suggests that prediluvian geography did basically resemble postdiluvian geography\" (Young 1977, p 210). Reference is made particularly to the topographical descriptions in connection with the Garden of Eden: the lands of Havilah and Cush, and the four rivers, two of which (the Tigris and the Euphrates) were familiar to the readers of Genesis in Moses' time.  What is not recognized in these arguments, however, is that although there are some similarities between the prediluvian and postdiluvian topography, there are more differences than similarities. Two of the rivers mentioned apparently no longer existed in Moses' time: the Pishon and Gihon are mentioned in terms of where they used to flow, in the postdiluvian areas of Havilah and Cush respectively. The other two rivers \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the Tigris and Euphrates \u00e2\u0080\u0094 are described as coming from a common source in the Garden of Eden, certainly far different from their present courses. Thus the topographical descriptions in the early chapters of Genesis are in harmony with a world-wide Flood. Also, it is likely that survivors of the Flood would use familiar names for topographical features after the Flood, even though the earth's surface looked entirely different.  Ninth, the duration of the Flood makes sense only with a universal flood. The Deluge of rain from above and water from the fountains of the deep below continued 40 days (Genesis 7:17), and all the highest mountains were still covered five months after the Flood began; the tops of the mountains were not seen until after seven months, and the Flood waters were not dried up enough for Noah to leave the ark until one year and ten days had passed (see Genesis 7:11; 8:14). Such lengths of time seem commensurate only with a universal and not a local flood.  Tenth, the receding activity of the water (Genesis 8:3a, 54a) is described by Hebrew phrases which, in parallel with similar phraseology and grammatical construction for the \"to and fro\" motion of the raven (Genesis 8:7), should be translated as \"going and retreating,\" (see Austin 1990, p 218; Hasel 1978, p 93) and imply oscillatory water motion lasting for 74 days (see Genesis 8:3-5). The waters rushing back and forth like in ocean tidal movement as the overall level gradually decreased, supports a universal interpretation such as \"the oceanic energy impulse model of the flood\" (Austin 1990, p 218), but is incongruous with a local flood theory.  Eleventh, the NT passages concerning the Flood all employ universal language: \"swept them all away\" (Matthew 24:39); \"destroyed them all,\" (Luke 17:27); \"he did not spare the ancient world, but preserved Noah with seven other persons, ... when he brought a flood upon the world of the ungodly\" (2 Peter 2:5); \"a few, that is eight persons, were saved through water\" (1 Peter 3:20); Noah \"condemned the world\" (Hebrews 11:7). A local flood would not have ended the antediluvian world. As Archer states, \"we have the unequivocal corroboration of the New Testament that the destruction of the human race at the time of the flood was total and universal\" (Archer 1985, p 208).  Twelfth, the NT Flood typology assumes and depends upon not only the historicity, but also the universality, of the Flood to theologically argue for an imminent world-wide judgment by fire (2 Peter 3:6-7). Peter argues that just as there was a world-wide judgment by water causing the unbelieving antediluvian world to perish, so in the antitype there must-needs-be a universal end-time judgment by fire bringing about the destruction of the ungodly (see Davidson 1981, p 326-327).  Thirteenth, key terms and motifs that we have already noted in Genesis 6-9 converge to make a major theological statement: the Noahic Flood is nothing less than the cosmic undoing or reversal of creation. Numerous biblical scholars have recognized this highly significant theological point of the Flood narrative. Nahum Sarna writes that \"The Flood is a cosmic catastrophe that is actually the undoing of creation.\" In other words, creation is being undone, and the world returned to chaos (Sarna 1989, p 48).  Tikva Frymer-Kensky describes the Flood as \"the original, cosmic undoing of creation\" (Frymer-Kensky 1983, p 410; cf. Frymer-Kensky 1985, p 312). Claus Westermann speaks of the \"invasion of chaos into the created order; the flood assumed cosmic proportions\" (Westermann 1974/1984, p 434). Umberto Cassuto points out that at the high point of the Flood, \"We see water everywhere, as though the world had reverted to its primeval state at the dawn of Creation, when the waters of the Deep submerged everything\" (Cassuto 1964, p 97). David Clines uses the apt term bouleversement or \"reversal\" of creation to depict the theological significance of the Flood (Clines 1972, p 136). For Joseph Blenkinsopp,   ... the deluge is an act of uncreation, undoing the work of separation by returning everything to the primeval, watery chaos from which the created order first arose (Blenkinsopp 1992, p 83; cf. Blenkinsopp 1971, p 46-47).  Gerhard von Rad vividly underscores the universal implications of this undoing or reversal of creation:   ... we must understand the Flood, therefore, as a catastrophe involving the entire cosmos. When the heavenly ocean breaks forth upon the earth below, and the primeval sea beneath the earth, which is restrained by God, now freed from its bonds, gushes up through yawning chasms onto the earth, then there is a destruction of the entire cosmic system according to biblical cosmology. The two halves of the chaotic primeval sea, separated \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the one up, the other below \u00e2\u0080\u0094 by God's creative government (ch. 1:7-9), are again united; creation begins to sink into chaos. Here the catastrophe, therefore, concerns not only men and beasts ... but the earth (chs. 6.13; 9.1) \u00e2\u0080\u0094 indeed, the entire cosmos (von Rad 1972, p 128).  Only a cosmic/universal Flood can theologically encompass the cosmic/universal reversal or undoing of creation described in Genesis 6-9.  Fourteenth and last, the cosmic reversal of creation is followed by a cosmic New Beginning. As Clines states it:   ... the 'uncreation' which God has worked with the Flood is not final; creation has not been permanently undone. Old unities of the natural world are restored (8:22), and the old ordinances of creation are renewed (9:1-7) (Clines 1972-73, p 138).  Jacques Doukhan has shown the precise literary parallels between the successive stages of \"re-creation\" in the aftermath of the Flood (Genesis 8-9) and the seven days of creation in Genesis 1-2 (Doukhan 1987, p 133-134; cf. Gage 1984, p 10-20):   The wind over the earth and waters. Gen. 8:1; cf. Gen. 1:2.   Division of waters. Gen. 8:1-5; cf. Gen. 1:6-8.   Appearance of plants. Gen. 8:6-12; cf. Gen. 1:9-13.   Appearance of light. Gen. 8:13-14; cf. Gen. 1:14-19.   Deliverance of animals. Gen. 8:15-17; cf. Gen. 1:20-23.   Animals together with men, blessing, food for men, image of God. Gen. 8:18-9:7; cf. Gen. 1:24-31.   Sign of covenant. Gen. 9:8-17; cf. Gen. 2:1-3.   Thus in the over-arching literary structure of the \"re-creation\" in the Flood narrative, the universal dimension of the Flood is underscored by detailed parallels with the cosmic creation account of Genesis 1-2.  IV. Conclusion  In conclusion, the question of the extent of the Genesis Flood is not just a matter of idle curiosity with little at stake for Christian faith. For those who see the days of creation in Genesis 1 as six, literal 24-hour days (see Hasel 1994), a universal Flood is an absolute necessity to explain the existence of the geologic column. A literal creation week is inextricably linked with a world-wide flood.  But a universal Flood is crucial not only in seeking to reconcile science and Scripture. It is also pivotal in understanding and remaining faithful to the theology of Genesis 1-11 and the rest of Scripture. (For a more detailed discussion of the theology of the Genesis Flood in its canonical context, see Davidson in press.) The many links with the universal creation in Genesis 1-2 which we have noted in this study not only support the aspect of universality in the Flood, but serve to theologically connect Protology (Creation) and Eschatology (Judgment/Salvation) in the opening chapters of Scripture. The Flood is an eschatological step-by-step \"uncreation\" of the world and humanity followed by a step-by-step \"re-creation\" of the new world. \"Thus,\" writes von Rad, \"the story of the Flood \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and this is theologically the most important fact \u00e2\u0080\u0094 shows an eschatological world judgment.... The world judgment of the Flood hangs like an iron curtain between this world age and that of the first splendor of creation\" (von Rad 1972, p 129-130).  The theology of the universal Flood is therefore the pivot of a connected but multi-faceted universal theme running through Genesis 1-11 and constituting an over-arching pattern for the entire subsequent world-wide creation revealing the character of the Creator and His original purpose for creation; humankind's turning from the Creator and the universal spread of sin ending in the universal \"uncreation\" through eschatological judgment; and re-creation, in the eschatological salvation of the faithful covenant remnant and the universal renewal of the earth.", "label": "fact"}

Consider for a moment what you actually mean by 'materialistically': what is it that defines something as being material? Gravity is every bit as intangible as a miracle, yet you would automatically characterise it as being part of the material world. Why? The answer is that it is amenable to the scientific method: assertions about gravity can be repeatably tested. If ghosts and poltergeists were amenable to the same methodology, it would be possible to construct scientific theories concerning those, too, and they would be considered no more exotic or 'supernatural' than clouds or rainbows.  When you get your head around that, it's immediately apparent that it isn't the power of prayer or spirituality per se that aren't scientific, it's the methodology people have for dealing with them. Indeed, when the scientific method is applied and doesn't yield the results believers in such matters want, the typical response is to come up with excuses why we shouldn't expect the scientific method to work. Unfortunately you can't have it both ways; if you want to come to the party you have to adopt the dress code.  Really, none of this would be a problem if science didn't have a (from a religious perspective) nasty habit of finding explanations for, or hidden and unexpected complexities within, features of the material world about which religious texts or leaders had already made firm pronouncements. Because despite the fact that you, SS, and others see science and evolution as an enemy of your philosophy and spirituality, the actual bone of contention is always in the material world. So who's really treading on whose toes here? It's your choice to shackle your spirituality to a particular - and demonstrably wrong - version of material events, SS, not mine.", "label": "fact"}

{"text": "Thanks Patriot for the well researched response.  Although I am not a gun rights advocate, I am also not anti-gun and in the spirit of trying to get the two sides of this issue to reach some sort of understanding, here is what I believe to be the major points of those who support a ban on assult weapons.  First of all, I do agree that the definition of assult weapons is a little strange, and it essentially boils down to the guns that look scary.  However, the spirit of the law was to try to ban weapons whose main purpose was militaristic in nature. That is, guns that are able to be fired rapidly, have a large magazine, and reasonable stopping power. Thus, although the ban would not eliminate all of the \"dangerous\" weapons ( I assume that an M1, the rifle that beat the Nazis, would be legal) it does cover a lot of them.  Of course, most 2nd amendment rights supporters would say that all this doesn't matter, it doesn't matter what purpose the gun serves, it is unconstitutional to infringe upon the rights of Americans to own any gun they want, no matter the purpose.  What gun control advocates would say, however, is that the constitution says 'arms' not guns, and it becomes the job of the goverment to determine what was meant my this. I think that most gun control advocates would agree that the second amendment probably did not intend for people to be able to buy chemical or biological weapons, for example. And, I for one, hope that is not what they meant, particularly in light of the recent war on terrorism.  A common remark is \"why would it matter if I had a nuclear weapon if I am a law abiding citizen and would never use it against my neighbor?\" The problem is that we don't know what the intention of everyone is, and there are certainly terrorists in this country now who are American citizens and would use such powerful weapons against usif they were able to acquire them.  Of course a semi-automatic .223 caliber rifle is not the same as a chemical weapon, but the point is that (I think) most people don't think that you should be able to own absolutely any weapon that you want, so one must attempt to define what is too dangerous for ordinary citizens to own.   I don't think that I covered all of your points, Patriot, but this is getting long, so I will cut this off here, and I hope to get a response from you. I will be interested in your thoughts.  -Dan", "label": "fact"}

I mean, they're galaxies. Right there, in a picture in front of you. I'm struggling to understand what you think can have gone wrong :)  Let's use the same kind of analogy you've employed. If I want to take a picture of a basketball, I can do that close up, right? But if I want to take a picture of 1500 basketballs, all spaced out, I have no option but to do so from further away. With a standard 28mm lens on a 35mm camera, and allowing 4 square feet of floor per basketball, I would need to be roughly 90 feet up in the air to fit them all in the frame.  Now imagine I want to take that same picture with an extreme telephoto lens, equivalent to peeking through a dime-sized hole seventy-five feet away. In order to see all those basketballs through that hole, they're going to have to be a bit further away. Almost nineteen miles in fact.  Now make them 1500 earth-sized planets. It's a straightforward scaling up of similar triangles: now I'd have to be almost 2,000,000,000 miles away. 1500 suns? 217,011,334,736 miles away. 1500 solar systems (just out to pluto, not including the comets)? 919,679,070,315,789 miles away, or 156LY. If we include the comets, that becomes 2,299,197,675,789,472,500 miles.  But we aren't looking at basketballs, planets, or solar systems. We're looking at galaxies, giving us a whopping 145,473,622,268,931,148,838,190 miles or 24,746,725,672 LY. Now, that's actually rather more than the measured distance to those galaxies, mainly because I'm assuming they're all laid out flat.

Those with high taxes are much more able to give money without losing those things essential to a decent standard of living. Is it equal?

GM and Ford know that 100% of all the product they sell will be used illegally. Everyone of their cars will be used to break speed limits. No one obeys speed limts, the only time speed limits are obeyed is when a cop is watching. Yet GM and Ford are not responsible for all the illegal activity of their products.  Shifting the responsbility for enforcement breaks many traditions and laws regarding individual personal responsibility. When a customer breaks a law using a product, manufactures are not responsible, that goes for both guns and cars, or any product that is sold and used for criminal purposes.  There certainly a lack of cooperation between the ATF and the NRA. They really should be working together. It takes two sides to make a conflict. The ATF is trying to single out gun manufactures to be responsible for policing customers. NO OTHER INDUSTRY is being held accountable like that. That is why there is a conflict between the NRA and ATF. The NRA asks that gun manufactures to be treated with the same consideration of existing laws and standards applied to other industries. The NRA supports any efforts to take firearms away from criminals, but they are asking that gun manufactures not be held accountable for customer illegal activity.

It also sometimes carries the connotation of progress. But none of these meanings are applicable to theories of biological evolution. There is no concept of purpose or direction to the word when used in a biological context.  Here is a more precise definition of evolution: evolution is a change in the heritable characteristics of a population of living organisms over generations. When scientist or a knowledgable amateur speaks of the \"theory of evolution,\" it is this theory that is being discussed. Unmodified, the term has come to mean biological evolution. Those who include the big bang (cosmological evolution) or the formation, life and death of stars (stelar evolution) are either ignorant or dishonest.

That information is transferred to the person trying to open it via feedback: when you get the right code, the case opens. If there was no feedback - if the person was not actually opening the case themselves but was just blindly shouting numbers for someone else to try with no idea if it was working or not - they would be none the wiser.  Similarly, the nylon waste products metabolised by the nylon bug intrinsically possess all the necessary information concerning how they can be broken down.

You interestingly enough bring up the so-called \"scientific dating methods\". Well, did you know that out of the 200 possible dating methods that we can apply, only 20 of those methods bring an age for things that fits with the evolutionary theory. Since you have some education in paleontology I trust that you know that most fossils do not usually contain radioactive minerals, so they cannot usually be dated by radiometric means. What is usually done is to find a volcanic flow in association with the fossil layer, and try to date that using methods such as the potassium-argon dating. Now, there have been several examples where radio-dating methods have failed.  In the \"Creation Magazine\" there have been detailed reprots in which wood found in \"250-million-year-old\" sandstone, or in volcanic rock \"tens of millions of years old\" has given carbon-dating results of only thousands of years. Now you should know that if the wood was really 250 million years old there would be no radio-carbon isotopes in the wood. Radio-carbon dating only gives dates limited to a few thousand years according to evolutionary theory. So now comes the question, which one are you going to trust? This example came from: Snelling, A., \"Radioactive dating in conflict!\", Creation 20(1):24-27, 1998. Also when creation geologists sample volcanic rock known to have flowed in historic times, sending it to reputable radiometric dating labs, such as Oxford, the \"dating\" almost invariably gives results in the millions of years! This came from: Snelling, A., \"Radioactive Dating Failure\", Creation 22(1):18-21, 2000. This strongly suggests that the assumptions behind the dating methods are flawed.

Secondly, Virginian law (where the case originates from) makes no distinction between a domestic relationship (that which he was tried and convicted of) and between the agressor.  Quote majority ruling:  A domestic relationship, although it must be established beyond a reasonable doubt in a \u00c2\u00a7922(g)(9) firearms possession prosecution, need not be a defining element of the predicate offense. Pp. 4\u00e2\u0080\u009313.  Bulldung.  If congress wanted to make it simpler they would have just said battery instead of domestic violence. How the heck they came up with that is beyond me. They basically expanded the meaning of the Lautenberg Amendment, which is a big NO NO! I think that is what Justice Roberts was saying in his dissent.  Quote Justice Roberts dissent:  That reading does not require the specified domestic relationship in clause (ii) to be an element of the predicate misdemeanor statute. Individuals convicted under generic use-of-force statutes containing no reference to domestic violence would there-fore be subject to prosecution under \u00c2\u00a7922(g)(9).  ....

{"text": "Just a couple of points:  First, I believe your characterization that it is the far-right that is seeking to limit third-term abortions is incorrect. There seems to be large support on these forums from both the pro-choice and the pro-life side regarding third trimester abortions. Likewise, the general public seems to have been so upset with the Supreme Courts decision in Stenburg that Congress stepped in and passed a nearly identical statute to the Nebraska law. That statute cleared the Senate with the support of 16 Democrats, and it cleared the House with the support of 63 Democrats.  That is not to ignore the fact that it is largely Republicans that would go further than third trimester restrictions. I am merely trying to point out that Roe stands in the way of restrictions that we all support (third trimester), and thus we all should hope for legal reform in this area.  Secondly, the slippery slope argument is common, and I will address it in more detail later. My basic point is that if we really do think that third trimester fetuses have a significant moral status (and I take people at their word on this), than we should work to reform abortion laws in the United States. And that reform, as I am trying to argue, must begin with the undermining of Roe v. Wade.  Note that I have not yet discussed whether Roe v. Wade should be overturned. I do plan on discussing the legal issues with this case. But as of now, I am only trying to lay some groundwork for why that discussion is so important. A lot of people that I speak with seem to think the law is so technical that it cannot be understood (or is too hard to be understood), and thus they would rather not bother with it.

Gun must be locked and inaccessible to any child under 18.   The Government would have the right to come and inspect that you are storing your gun safely away from accessibility to children and fine is punishable for up to 5 yrs. in prison.

Neither researcher disclosed this information to JAMA.  This is an incidence of researcher bias entering into the scientific method. And your belief in this article takes faith.  Steve Calvin August 30, 2005 In the Minneapolis Star-Tribune  Last week's article on fetal pain in the Journal of the American Medical Association proves the desperation of the defenders of unrestricted abortion. The article reviews medical literature and concludes that fetuses are unlikely to feel pain prior to 30 weeks gestation.  The authors were clearly motivated to write what I view as a medical fantasy to counter proposed federal legislation that would limit abortion in the second trimester. The legislation would require informing women considering abortion that fetuses beyond 20 weeks feel pain and would require anesthesia for the fetus.  Twenty-five years of delivering babies and a specialization in high-risk obstetrics provide me some experience to refute the claim that fetuses feel no pain until 30 weeks. Many of the tiny babies that I deliver, some as small as 1 pound at 23 weeks, have required surgery during their difficult neonatal battle for life. All of them receive anesthesia.  Before the 1970s, many newborns, both term and preterm, were operated on without anesthesia in the mistaken belief that they could not feel pain. They certainly couldn't tell anyone about their discomfort. With more sophisticated monitoring it became clear that blood pressure and pulse rose dramatically during the trauma of surgery. Subsequently, a subspecialty of pediatric anesthesia developed.  Those who deny fetal pain claim that hormonal and withdrawal responses to invasive procedures are mere reflexes and are no evidence of pain. Recently, I performed an amniocentesis on a patient at 21 weeks gestation because of a possible infection. On ultrasound, the fetus pulled away from the needle when it grazed her arm. It is clear to me that this fetus felt discomfort, and that she would feel horrible pain if she were dismembered in the exercise of an unjust constitutional right.  The medical literature duel over abortion has been quite one-sided since most of the medical hierarchy is ardently pro-abortion. There are, however, courageous exceptions.  The most important medical study on abortion this year got absolutely no media coverage. A French study in the April 2005 British Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology convincingly showed that a previous abortion increased the risk of subsequent delivery at 22 to 27 weeks by 70 percent. Premature birth has heavy personal and societal costs, yet the alarm over the increasing rate of prematurity ignores the abortion connection.  The fight over requirements for informed consent prior to abortion continues because abortion defenders refuse to accept any restriction on this manufactured constitutional right to exercise prenatal lethal violence. Their blind orthodoxy requires denial of fetal pain and willful ignorance of the significant long-term consequences of abortion.  Steve Calvin is a Minneapolis physician.", "label": "fact"}

There's no reason at all for a designer capable of making an octupus to use the inferior mammalian design.  Then there's the issue of vestigial features. Vestigial doesn't necessarily mean 'useless', more properly it describes something that is 'overengineered' for the purpose it currently serves, and often looks very much like a crippled version of a feature possessed by some other species. Ostrich wings, for example, may be useful for balancing when running, or in mating rituals, but they don't need to be wings in order to serve those purposes. Their complex and delicate internal structure is clearly 'designed' to allow flight, but their stunted development and the practical impossibility of such a big bird achieving self-powered flight make them a vestigial structure. Again, what rationale can be made for this being the work of a designer?  Then there's the fossil record. Try as one might to twist the evidence to fit a biblical flood, it just won't go. Paleontologists have found spider tracks sandwiched in sandstone layers. Imagine, if you can, the delicate impressions of a spider's footsteps surviving a deluge sufficient to suspend and deposit yards and yards of sand atop them. Hydrodynamic sorting of fossils, or burial order, doesn't fit either, since it requires that we pretend all dinosaurs were large and slow moving (they weren't) and that all mammals are small, agile and fast-moving (they aren't).  On and on it goes. If we take evolution off the table completely and look at the evidence before us, we have no explanation that fits. Special creation simply doesn't add up. With all creation myths falsified, what are we supposed to do? Just pretend the history of life on earth doesn't matter, or should be ignored?  Evolution isn't what you come up with when you apply atheist thinking. Evolution is what you come up with when you discount all the extant hypotheses that don't fit the facts, be they religiously inspired or otherwise.  Now, you may hold your hand up and complain that we're not admitting the possibility of some kind of divine guiding hand steering or helping evolution. And that's fair enough; we generally don't, for two different reasons:  First, it doesn't really add anything to the theory; it doesn't increase its power to explain what we see. So while you can of course choose to believe that's what's happening, it doesn't have any scientific value.  Secondly, there's arguably some merit in the attitude that religion has had its chance and blown it. For thousands of years religions have claimed to bear upon their backs the infallible word of god. Now, if the bible had been saying all along - centuries before the technology existed to verify it - that god coaxed organisms into evolving from simpler organisms over millions of years, that would be compelling evidence that the bible was accurate and divinely inspired, since it would contain accurate predictions (which no man could have made) about what we should find when we look into our DNA or beneath the ground. But it doesn't make those predictions. So why should we now pay attention when Intelligent Design evangelists do a 6000-year-too-late handbrake turn and invent a new faith-based explanation for the evidence? After all, they have no divine mandate to do so - it's the bible that's supposedly the word of god; they're just making stuff up as they go along.", "label": "fact"}

{"text": "Really .   \"The voice of one crying in the wilderness: \"Prepare the way of the LORD; Make straight in the desert a highway for our God. (NKJV).\" Isaiah 40:3   \"In those days John the Baptist came preaching in the wilderness of Judea, and saying, 'Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand!' For this is he who was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah, saying: 'The voice of one crying in the wilderness: Prepare the way of the LORD . . . (NKJV).'\" Matt. 3:1-3   John the Baptist came before Jesus Christ and let people know that He was coming. What a fascinating period of history. This prediction was given by the prophet Isaiah, 740-680 B.C. History tell us that John the Baptist did in fact come preaching repentance and baptism.   \"But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are small among the clans of Judah, out of you will come . . . one who will be ruler over Israel, whose origins are from of old, from ancient times (NIV).\" Micah 5:2   \" After Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea, during the time of King Herod . . . (NIV)\" Matt. 2:1   Micah, 735 - 710 B.C., tells us that the Christ or Messiah will be born in Bethlehem. It is recognized by all that Jesus was indeed born in Bethlehem.   Therefore the Lord Himself will give you a sign: Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a Son, and shall call His name Immanuel (NKJV).\" Isaiah 7:14   \"Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take to you Mary your wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit. And she will bring forth a Son, and you shall call His name JESUS, for He will save His people from their sins . . . His name [is] Immanuel (NKJV)\" Matt. 1:20-23.   \"This is what the LORD says: \"A voice is heard in Ramah, mourning and great weeping, Rachel weeping for her children and refusing to be comforted, because her children are no more (NIV).\" Jer. 31:15   \"When Herod realized that he had been outwitted by the Magi, he was furious, and he gave orders to kill all the boys in Bethlehem and its vicinity who were two years old and under . . .then the [prophecy] was fulfilled (NIV).\" Matt. 2:16-4:1   Through the prophet Jeremiah, 627 - 580 B.C., God indicated that some of Israel's children would be killed at the coming of the Messiah.   \"When Israel was a child, I loved him, And out of Egypt I called My son.\" Hosea 11:1   \"Now when they had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying, \"Arise, take the young Child and His mother, flee to Egypt, and stay there until I bring you word; for Herod will seek the young Child to destroy Him. When he arose, he took the young Child and His mother by night and departed for Egypt, and was there until the death of Herod, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying, \"Out of Egypt I called My Son.\" (NKJV).'\" Matt. 2:13-15   This prophecy was given by the prophet Hosea around 750 B.C. This amazing prophecy says that Messiah would come from Egypt. Jesus had to be born into the family of David, born of a virgin, born in Bethlehem, children would die and Jesus come out of Egypt. The prophet must have wondered why Messiah would come out of Egypt. This did not fit the concept the Jews had about Messiah. This is God's plan and these are God's prophecies.   \"They divide my garments among them, and for my clothing they cast lots (NKJV).\" Ps. 22:18   \"Then they crucified Him, and divided His garments, casting lots, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet: \"They divided My garments among them, And for My clothing they cast lots (NKJV).\" Matt. 27:35   After the soldiers crucified Jesus (nailed Him to the cross), they gambled for Jesus' clothes. Little did they know they were fulfilling a 1000 years old prophecy. The prediction was provided by God through King David.   \"I will pour on the house of David and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem the Spirit of grace and supplication; then they will look on Me whom they pierced (NKJV).\" Zech. 12:10   \"But one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and immediately blood and water came out.  For these things [occurred] that the Scripture should be fulfilled . . . \"They shall look on Him whom they pierced (NKJV).\" John 19:34-37   Another isolated event predicted in 520-512 B.C. In A.D. 33, some soldier thrust his spear into the side of Jesus to make sure that He would die before 6 pm that evening. Little did he realize that Jesus was already dead (John 19:30) and that he was fulfilling a 480 year old prophecy from Zechariah.   \"Even my own familiar friend in whom I trusted, who ate my bread, has lifted up His heel against me (NKJV).\" Ps. 41:9   \"Judas Iscariot . . . betrayed Him.\" Matt. 10:4  \"that the scripture might be fulfilled, 'He who eats My bread has lifted up his heel against Me (NKJV).\" John 13:21-28   This prediction was recorded by King David, 1020 - 970 B.C. It refers to the Messiah's betrayal by His friends. Judas is well known as the one who agreed to help the Romans capture Jesus at a cost of 30 pieces of silver. Peter was another who betrayed Jesus three times.   \"See, your king comes to you, righteous and having salvation, gentle and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey (NIV).\" Zech 9:9   \"And the disciples . . . brought the donkey and the colt, and laid on them garments, on which he sat. And most of the multitude spread their garments in the road, and others were cutting branches from the trees and spreading them in the road (NIV).\" Matt. 21:6-8   Zechariah, 480 - 470 B.C., stated that Messiah, the king, would come riding on a donkey. Donkeys were sometimes ridden in times of peace (Judges 5:10) but stallions were normally used by kings. This is unexpected by those looking for a military Messiah.

They also offer birth control, gynecological care, STD testing, infertility testing, sexual education counseling, prenatal care, adoption referrals.. etc...Almost all of these things are offered by my regular doctor, and probably most other doctors as well. They don't have a maternity ward at Planned Parenthood because they aren't a hospital, and you can go to your own hospital to have an ultrasound done, but if a clinic does an abortion themselves, they have to do an ultrasound first, to determine how far along the pregnancy is, because there are different procedures for different amounts of weeks.

I may not have made this clear, but here are the facts:  1) A unique human entity comes into existence at the point of conception/fertilization.

The zygote/blastocyst/embryo/fetus/neonate/baby/child (whichever label you choose) is a member of the species homo sapiens sapiens.

So we have two one sided worldviews, and one neutral one.

The answer of course, is politics. Science has become more and more politicized as the domestic federal government grows larger and larger.

So far this is fitting with your view of evolution.  The bit where you seem to get confused is to then think what are the triggers acting on? Is the information that encodes the changes in the environment or within the genes - clearly if you put various organisms into an environment they do not all change the same way. The fish that get larger in the absence of predators are clearly going to react in the opposite way to the predators themselves.  The key to the idea here is that they are triggers - things which then cause other things to create the effect we see. Genes are turned on, off or have the amount of expression altered by external effects, Bacteria have whole sets of genes that are generally switched off until the situation triggers them. Does this mean the bacteria have suddenly learned how to produce some essential amino acid, due to the innate property of an amino acid lacking environment, or that the environment has triggered a change in the expression of genes and causing something to happen that wasn't happening before?", "label": "fact"}

{"text": "I was unaware that chocked full and non-existant were synonomous,learn something new everyday.  I agree , who would believe in dino to birds after reading this , an idiot? Wrong answer , an evolutionist would. I guess those are synonyms as well.  Just so you can't say I took it out of context here is Dr. Olsen's letter in it's entirety.  National Museum of Natural History   Smithsonian Institution   Washington, D. C. 20560   1 November 1999   OPEN LETTER TO:   Dr. Peter Raven, Secretary   PRaven@nas.org   Committee for Research and Exploration   National Geographic Society   Washington, DC 20036   Dear Peter,   I thought that I should address to you the concerns expressed below because your committee is at least partly involved and because you are certainly now the most prominent scientist at the National Geographic Society.   With the publication of \"Feathers for T. rex?\" by Christopher P. Sloan in its November issue, National Geographic has reached an all-time low for engaging in sensationalistic, unsubstantiated, tabloid journalism. But at the same time the magazine may now claim to have taken its place in formal taxonomic literature.   Although it is possible that Mr. Czerkas \"will later name\" the specimen identified on page 100 as Archaeoraptor liaoningensis, there is no longer any need for him to do so.   Because this Latinized binomial has apparently not been published previously and has now appeared with a full-spread photograph of the specimen \"accompanied by a description or definition that states in words characters that are purported to differentiate the taxon,\" the name Archaeoraptor liaoningensis Sloan is now available for purposes of zoological nomenclature as of its appearance in National Geographic (International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, Article 13a, i). This is the worst nightmare of many zoologists---that their chance to name a new organism will be inadvertently scooped by some witless journalist. Clearly, National Geographic is not receiving competent consultation in certain scientific matters.   Sloan's article explicitly states that the specimen in question is known to have been illegally exported and that \"the Czerkases now plan to return it to China.\" In Washington, in June of 1996, more than forty participants at the 4th International Meeting of the Society of Avian Paleontology and Evolution, held at the Smithsonian Institution, were signatories to a letter to the Director of the Chinese Academy of Sciences that deplored the illegal trade in fossils from China and encouraged the Chinese government to take further action to curb this exploitation.   There were a few fossil dealers at that meeting and they certainly got the message. Thus, at least since mid-1996 it can hardly have been a secret to anyone in the scientific community or the commercial fossil business that fossils from Liaoning offered for sale outside of China are contraband.   Most, if not all, major natural history museums in the United States have policies in effect that prohibit their staff from accepting any specimens that were not legally collected and exported from the country of origin. The National Geographic Society has not only supported research on such material, but has sensationalized, and is now exhibiting, an admittedly illicit specimen that would have been morally, administratively, and perhaps legally, off-limits to researchers in reputable scientific institutions.   Prior to the publication of the article \"Dinosaurs Take Wing\" in the July 1998 National Geographic, Lou Mazzatenta, the photographer for Sloan's article, invited me to the National Geographic Society to review his photographs of Chinese fossils and to comment on the slant being given to the story. At that time, I tried to interject the fact that strongly supported alternative viewpoints existed to what National Geographic intended to present, but it eventually became clear to me that National Geographic was not interested in anything other than the prevailing dogma that birds evolved from dinosaurs.   Sloan's article takes the prejudice to an entirely new level and consists in large part of unverifiable or undocumented information that \"makes\" the news rather than reporting it. His bald statement that \"we can now say that birds are theropods just as confidently as we say that humans are mammals\" is not even suggested as reflecting the views of a particular scientist or group of scientists, so that it figures as little more than editorial propagandizing. This melodramatic assertion had already been disproven by recent studies of embryology and comparative morphology, which, of course, are never mentioned.   More importantly, however, none of the structures illustrated in Sloan's article that are claimed to be feathers have actually been proven to be feathers. Saying that they are is little more than wishful thinking that has been presented as fact. The statement on page 103 that \"hollow, hairlike structures characterize protofeathers\" is nonsense considering that protofeathers exist only as a theoretical construct, so that the internal structure of one is even more hypothetical.   The hype about feathered dinosaurs in the exhibit currently on display at the National Geographic Society is even worse, and makes the spurious claim that there is strong evidence that a wide variety of carnivorous dinosaurs had feathers. A model of the undisputed dinosaur Deinonychus and illustrations of baby tyrannosaurs are shown clad in feathers, all of which is simply imaginary and has no place outside of science fiction.   The idea of feathered dinosaurs and the theropod origin of birds is being actively promulgated by a cadre of zealous scientists acting in concert with certain editors at Nature and National Geographic who themselves have become outspoken and highly biased proselytizers of the faith. Truth and careful scientific weighing of evidence have been among the first casualties in their program, which is now fast becoming one of the grander scientific hoaxes of our age---the paleontological equivalent of cold fusion. If Sloan's article is not the crescendo of this fantasia, it is difficult to imagine to what heights it can next be taken. But it is certain that when the folly has run its course and has been fully exposed, National Geographic will unfortunately play a prominent but unenviable role in the book that summarizes the whole sorry episode.

{"text": "Actually its one of the oldest gun laws on the books.  The Sullivan Act, also known as the Sullivan Law, is a controversial gun control law in New York State. Upon first passage, the Sullivan Act required licenses for New Yorkers to possess firearms small enough to be concealed. Possession of such firearms without a license was a misdemeanor, carrying them was a felony. The possession or carrying of weapons such as brass knuckles, sandbags, blackjacks, bludgeons or bombs was a felony, as was possessing or carrying a dagger, \"dangerous knife\" or razor \"with intent to use the same unlawfully\". Named for its primary legislative sponsor, state senator Timothy Sullivan, a notoriously corrupt Tammany Hall politician, it dates to 1911, and is still in force, making it one of the older existing gun control laws in the United States.  Many believe the act was to discriminate against immigrants in New York, particularly Italians, as the first person arrested under the law was mobster Giuseppe Costabile. Whether this was part of the law's intent, it was passed on a wave of anti-immigrant rhetoric as a measure to disarm an alleged criminal element. The police granted the licenses, and could easily discriminate against \"undesirable\" elements. Sponsor \"Big Tim\" Sullivan reputedly desired the law so that his criminal cohorts could go about their activities unimpeded by citizens defending themselves with concealed handguns. It was used against political enemies by dropping a small pistol into an overcoat pocket. Thus having them arrested and put in jail for violation. Big Tim stepped in front of a speeding subway train.", "label": "fact"}

And now you want his publication in a particular form too! Another slight of hand.  Despite this I countered that he has published.  I said Dembski had come up with a filter  The accusation was that he hadn't applied this to a biological system.  Yet everyone seems to be able to critique this 'invisible' application.  Now with typical aplomb WJA chimes in and you don't go down the path of SLP in actually making any claim. You want me to come up with the goods.  This is the neat trick.

A small shift again of the argument.  However, because I'm trying to educate you I suggest your read the following.  \"In the actual encounter, Dembski began by overviewing his methods for design detection as developed in The Design Inference. He then  sketched how these methods apply to biology  and why he thought they provided in-principle objections to undirected natural causes, including Kauffman's self-organizational processes, generating the key item that his methods detect, namely, specified complexity or complex specified information. Dembski developed his argument as follows: the only way for self-organizational, Darwinian, and other naturalistic methods to generate specified complexity is by in essence dissolving the actual complexity (or improbability). What seems highly improbable is therefore no longer improbable once one knows the right naturalistic process. Dembski indicated that there were good reasons to think that no such reduction of complexity or improbability would be possible in the case of systems like the bacterial flagellum.  He also adverted to some of the techniques developed in his forthcoming book titled \"No Free Lunch\" for computing the probabilities of discrete combinatorial objects like the bacterial flagellum. \"  http://www.arn.org/docs/pjweekly/pj_weekly_011119.htm  This suggests that a book is about to appear mysteriously out of the ether...  So, go read the book  \"No Free Lunch: Why Specified Complexity Cannot Be Purchased Without Intelligence\". Unless you think it's not 'published'.  Oh, look it has been published! It's a miracle.  As far back as post 29 the answer was provided for one and all by SLP who wrote:  \"Unfortunately, Dembski and his \"explanatory\" filter are more hot air than substance. He has claiming to have 'discovered' desing (sic) in nature by using the 'filter', but for some strange reason, he has yet to publish his amazing discovery. he said he was going to do it in \"Mere Creation\", then he said it would be iun (sic)  No Free Lunch  - so tell us , IS IT actually in his newest collection of apocryphal tall tales, or is is (sic) just assumed that he has done so?\"  The simple answer is 'yes he has'.  This mystery book exists. It's even been criticised by people on your side \"In his book, No Free Lunch,  Dembski presents the bacterial flagellum as the premier example of a biological system that, because he judges it to be both complex and specified, must have been actualized by the form-conferring action of an unembodied intelligent agent. However, a critical examination of Dembski?s case reveals that, 1) is is built  on unorthodox and inconsistently applied definitions of both ?complex? and ?specified,? 2) it employs a concept of the flagellum?s assembly that is radically out of touch with contemporary genetics and developmental biology, and 3)  it fails to demonstrate  that the flagellum is either ?complex? or ?specified? in the manner required to make his case. If the bacterial flagellum is supposed to demonstrate ID, then ID is a failure.\"  http://www.iscid.org/ubbcgi/ultimate...=1;t=000057;p=  As I said, people on your side are out there criticising him all the time.

Why do textbooks claim that beak changes in Galapagos finches during a severe drought can explain the origin of species by natural selection -- even though the changes were reversed after the drought ended, and no net evolution occurred?   MUTANT FRUIT FLIES. Why do textbooks use fruit flies with an extra pair of wings as evidence that DNA mutations can supply raw materials for evolution -- even though the extra wings have no muscles and these disabled mutants cannot survive outside the laboratory?

I know it's a bit unusual in a public forum but I'd like to introduce a little personal history here by way of illustration of my path to atheism: I was educated during my most impressionable years (11-18) at a grammar school controlled by the Jesuits. All my teachers were priests and many were of formidable intellect. Every morning began with \"divine service\", every lesson was started and ended with a prayer. At noon we sang the Angelus and at 3.30 in the afternoon we finished the school day with Benediction. We had at least one session a day learning and reciting the catechism - so we could be word perfect in our answers to metaphysical questions. Yet all this religious conditioning failed to arouse any spark of faith in me. Sure, I conformed to all outward appearances, but inwardly I rebelled and I did not believe. So why didn't I believe - because my clergymen teachers gave me no REASONS to do so. When, eventually, during my last days at school I chose to reveal my disbelief - the Rector said, \"Well, after all, faith is a gift from God !\" , and I had received no such gift.   Since, in my view, there is no reasoned evidence for God's existence, why succumb to wish-fulfillment ? It's less comforting but more honest to be an atheist.", "label": "fact"}

{"text": "I would like to propose reasons that the theory of evolution is in jeopardy. First, you must realize that evolution is still a theory. Otherwise it would be called the Law of Evolution. We have the laws of physics, the laws of chemistry, the laws of mathematics, the laws of thermodynamics. These are all proved and documented and provide the basis of all our technology. They are true and wholeheartedly accepted by everyone. They are the Laws of the Universe. For evolution to become a law, it must fall in line with the other laws. There can be no contradictions. The truth must be the truth.   The Second Law of Thermodynamics states that Entropy must remain the same or increase. Entropy is the tendency toward chaos. Increasing entropy means increasing chaos. The universe is winding down on an irreversible path. Every process that takes place in nature, whether mechanical, electrical, chemical, or biological is winding down, becoming more chaotic. All processes will finally cease, and the Universe will stop. That is a scientific fact.   If the Universe is running down, becoming more chaotic all the time, how is it possible for any material to suddenly become more orderly, more organized, more complex. Scientists say, that random encounters of atoms, molecules, joining and splitting, eventually create order. I'm sorry, that's in direct contradiction to the Second Law. It would also violate the statisically probability of such an occurrence even over billions of years, especially in light of the complexity of organized biological systems and processes.   Which brings me to the second reason that evolution is in jeopardy: there is a huge difference between living and non-living things. There is a gigantic leap forward required to produce even a single-celled amoeba from a goo that contains all the elements required to make an amoeba. The goo is total chaos. The amoeba is a highly organized and complex living creature. The odds of random mixing by weather, earthquake, etc. that would produce an amoeba would be one in a billion billion billion. It's not going to happen.  Thirdly, look at DNA. Scientists are mapping the human genome, the very basis of life itself. What are they finding? Recorded information that literally contains the blueprint of a human being. Information so complex and so vast that it is taking literally years to decipher. And every bit of the human body carries DNA. Theorically, it is possible to take this blueprint and create a whole new human. How can a living creature so complex be an accident of nature?   Fourth, how do you explain human consciousness? How does this highly complex body of flesh and blood with its organic brain have the ability to not only be aware of the world, but also be aware of himself as a unique person? There is no biological or medical reason determined so far, despite decades of study. What freak accident could possibly have occurred to give the first descendant of apes the first spark of awareness?", "label": "fact"}

The only time \"channel\" becomes teleological is when something live [a human or a beaver, let's say] intententionally does the channeling. But since it is understood that mechanical forces can also 'channel', unintentional, out of simple mechanics, the word channel cannot be called teleological.

Radiometric dating--the process of determining the age of rocks from the decay of their radioactive elements--has been in widespread use for over half a century. There are over forty such techniques, each using a different radioactive element or a different way of measuring them. It has become increasingly clear that these radiometric dating techniques agree with each other and as a whole, present a coherent picture in which the Earth was created a very long time ago. Further evidence comes from the complete agreement between radiometric dates and other dating methods such as counting tree rings or glacier ice core layers. Many Christians have been led to distrust radiometric dating and are completely unaware of the great number of laboratory measurements that have shown these methods to be consistent. Many are also unaware that Bible-believing Christians are among those actively involved in radiometric dating.  This paper describes in relatively simple terms how a number of the dating techniques work, how accurately the half-lives of the radioactive elements and the rock dates themselves are known, and how dates are checked with one another.

Theory: A theory is more like a scientific law than a hypothesis. A theory is an explanation of a set of related observations or events based upon proven hypotheses and verified multiple times by detached groups of researchers. One scientist cannot create a theory; he can only create a hypothesis.  In general, both a scientific theory and a scientific law are accepted to be true by the scientific community as a whole. Both are used to make predictions of events. Both are used to advance technology.    Compare that definition to a religion. Religions are made up of people who believe in something and ask for no proof and ignore evidence to the contrary. Theories are made up of people who believe in something based on logic and much consideration with all evidence taken into account.

He found that adaptive genetic mutations arising systematically under these circumstances outnumbered maladaptive and inconsequential mutations to a high degree, statistically speaking.

{"text": "Radiocarbon is nevr used for 'millions of years'. It's used to measure human developments.  I suggest you read this.  Radiometric dating--the process of determining the age of rocks from the decay of their radioactive elements--has been in widespread use for over half a century. There are over forty such techniques, each using a different radioactive element or a different way of measuring them. It has become increasingly clear that these radiometric dating techniques agree with each other and as a whole, present a coherent picture in which the Earth was created a very long time ago. Further evidence comes from the complete agreement between radiometric dates and other dating methods such as counting tree rings or glacier ice core layers. Many Christians have been led to distrust radiometric dating and are completely unaware of the great number of laboratory measurements that have shown these methods to be consistent. Many are also unaware that Bible-believing Christians are among those actively involved in radiometric dating.

It was capable of powered flight. It had tiny, spiky teeth in its beak and was the size of a sparrow. Its hip was primitive compared to modern birds; its ilium, ischium, and pubis were all parallel and directed backward. Iberomesornis was named by paleontologists Sanz and Bonaparte in 1992. Fossils were found in Spain. The type species is I. romeralli.  ICHTHYORNIS  Ichthyornis (meaning  fish bird ) were 8 inch (20 cm) long, toothed, tern-like, extinct bird that date from the late Cretaceous period. It had a large head and beak. This powerful flyer is the oldest-known bird that had a keeled breastbone (sternum) similar to that of modern birds. It lived in flocks nesting on shorelines, and hunted for fish over the seas. Ichthyornis was originally found in 1872 in Kansas, USA, by a member of paleontologist Othniel C. Marsh's Yale University expedition. Fossils have been found in Kansas and Texas, USA and Alberta, Canada.

The principle argument I've argued in their similarities is that of why they do such a thing. What cannot be explained now or its relation to the greater whole is credited to a supernatural being, a being or set of beings that exists not entirely of the natural world. Where ancient animists believed that lightning was associated with the Gods, and that Volcanoes were the manifestation of Pele, the principle is the same. What cannot be explained or understood now is of a higher being. How did this rock get here? Where did deer come from? How do they exist in the larger picture? Animists assign souls, or anima to the inanimate and animate objects as a way to place what they do not understand into a coherent organized picture.  Intelligent design is no different. Only that it has replaced lightning, volcanoes and rain with the human eye and origin of the life. While it may not use the same identical concepts of anima to inanimate object, the core logic is identical.  What is too complex to understand or explain now is of a higher being.", "label": "fact"}

In the meantime it is too bad materialists don?t feel the same way about scientists investigating the role of immaterial forces such as volition and memory in living processes.

Bertvan: (I?ve substituted EAM for ?Darwinism? because today few Darwinists would acknowledge that adaptations originate in living organisms rather than their genomes. Most Darwinists are still stuck on versions of genetic accidents.) All organisms some ability to respond to stimuli. I agree that plants and sponges seem to have a lesser choice of optional responses than more complex organisms. Yet even they are capable of some creative response. I?ve seen evidenceconvincing to me that even single cultured cells are capable of some limited free response. However the options available to a DNA molecule must be miniscule. Yet the Darwinists seem to grant pieces of DNA the power to ?selfishly? control entire organisms.  Bertvan: Every living organism and every cell of every living organism has some limited ability to change and adapt in response to stimuli, intelligently and purposefully. Once volition is acknowledged as an aspect of living systems, the mechanisms may be found.  Bertvan: Darwin may have been skeptical or reductionism, but twentieth century biologists who called themselves Darwinists were not. Twenty-first century biologists will turn away from materialistic reductionism and investigate the non materialistic role of consciousness, volition, memory and information -- none of which take up space.", "label": "fact"}

{"text": "No, it's not.  The conditions under which evolution operated during the Cambrian/Vendian times were different from the conditions following that time in two main ways, and these differences can potentially account for the origin of the many animal body plans during those early periods and the lack of new ones since.  First, ~540 million years ago most animals were very much simpler (fewer cells, for example) than they are today, so changes to their developmental programs would have been better tolerated. The more complex any system is (the more parts it has, and the more coordinated and well-matched those parts must be, etc.), the more rigidly constrained and less amenable to a given magnitude of change it is. So the simpler developmental processes (simpler adult-form end product, fewer interactions between developmental genes, etc.) of early animals would have allowed for a 'large-scale' change to be incorporated into that animal's ontogeny, though if a change of the same magnitude were to occur today, it would be too disruptive to the complex developmental program and would be eliminated (note that 'large-scale change' refers to the adult form: the actual change that caused that altered end result could be a typical small scale mutation, in an early developmental stage). This it not to propose Goldschmidt's  hopeful monsters  that occur due to 'macromutations', but rather an intermediate position between that and the  only micromutations  view of gradualistic neo-Darwinism. And, as just mentioned, mutations in developmental processes (even ones that resulted in 'macromutations' in the adult form) would have been more tolerated in the simpler animals that existed ~540 mya than they would be in today's.  Second, ~540 million years ago animal diversity was extremely more limited than it is today, so there was a huge number of open niches: a plentitude the likes of which has never again existed on our planet. An organism that happened to find itself in one of the multitude of open niches (by means of a  semi-macro  mutation, the product of a change in a developmental gene) would have faced little if any competition. The reduced external competition would potentially allow the morphological variation(s), that would otherwise likely have been eliminated, to persist. (The sudden change could leave the organism with a lower level of internal coordination: over time, internal coadaptation could evolve to 'catch up' with the change in morphology: these internal adjustments would leave no trace in the fossil record).  Combining these two ideas produces a reasonable explanation of the 'explosion' in new body plans in Vendian/Cambrian times.", "label": "fact"}

We do not talk about robbing banks, raping women, stealing cars, selling drugs, or killing cops.  The gun owners here are HARMLESS and productive members of society. Felons are not.

There would be a single mass extinction event for ALL flora and fauna, not numerous, asynchronous extinctions in differing environments encompassing particular groups of creatures  2. This mass extinction would coincide with a single, large, relatively uniform stratum of a more or less heterogeneous composition, or perhaps a very few strata still with the same basic property, not numerous discontinuous strata  3. there would be numerous complete fossils of all creatures living at the time, to include soft-bodied creatures (since rapid burial followed by fossilization is much more likely to preserve soft tissues either via imprints or actual fossilization)  4. the complete fossils should all be found in contemporaneous strata, i.e., human fossils should be found in the same layers as dinosaurs  5. The biological species concept should be very simple to define, as all living (and extinct) creatures would be, first of all, much less diverse, and each 'kind' would be simple to classify  6. there would be no reason to find, or even to expect to find, a unity of basic forms or functions or genomic content in extant creatures (e.g., no 'universal' genetic code, mammals with more or less than 4 limbs, etc.)  Well, that is a few off the top of my head...", "label": "fact"}
